Take a seat.

Hello.

Hello, James Corden.

00:09:58.367 --> 00:10:01.667
I cannot tell you
how incredible it is

00:10:01.733 --> 00:10:04.667
to be here with all of you now.

00:10:04.733 --> 00:10:07.100
And we are... I should say
we are shooting now

00:10:07.167 --> 00:10:10.033
in front of the iconic fountain

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.867
where you shot
the opening credits.

00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:14.833
It's beautiful and it's lovely.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.100
It is, however, noisy...

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:19.700
- Yes.
- ...and difficult...

00:10:19.767 --> 00:10:22.167
difficult to conduct
an interview.

00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:24.900
So if you'll just wait,
watch this.

00:10:24.967 --> 00:10:28.433
Watch this for power.
Wait there.

00:10:34.267 --> 00:10:36.467
Done. Okay.

- Alright. I know. I know.
- Those are superpowers.

00:10:40.767 --> 00:10:41.967
You still got it.

00:10:42.033 --> 00:10:43.667
- I know.
- Had we known

00:10:43.733 --> 00:10:46.900
all those years ago.
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:46.967 --> 00:10:48.733
Now, how are we doing?

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.633
This has been an emotional day
for all of you.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.500
How are you feeling
to be together,

00:10:54.567 --> 00:10:56.767
the six of you right now?

00:10:56.833 --> 00:11:00.833
It's been so fantastic
and exciting.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:03.533
And we've literally just
sort of slipped right back

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.533
right... as we usually do.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.567
David, how have you
found this time?

00:11:08.633 --> 00:11:11.533
Really emotional.
Really, really fun, actually.

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:14.033
I felt, after the initial shock

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:16.167
of just being
in the same room together,

00:11:16.233 --> 00:11:21.133
just I think we all just fell
right into our same old...

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.367
our same old kind of joking
around like we're a family.

00:11:24.433 --> 00:11:27.300
- And so it really was...
- Regressed. We regressed.

00:11:27.367 --> 00:11:29.500
- We regressed, yeah.
- Back to 20s.

00:11:29.567 --> 00:11:32.700
How much do you
stay in touch?

00:11:32.767 --> 00:11:34.933
Yeah, no,
we stay in touch for sure.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.767
- Maybe not every day.
- Sure.

00:11:36.833 --> 00:11:40.100
But, you know,
we have such a bond

00:11:40.167 --> 00:11:43.600
from having done this show

00:11:43.667 --> 00:11:46.500
and forged
this very tight relationship

00:11:46.567 --> 00:11:48.433
that, you know,
any time you text

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.667
or call someone,
they're going to pick up.

00:11:51.733 --> 00:11:54.233
- They'll be there.
- Matthew, who doesn't pick up?

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:55.533

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.133

[LAUGHTER]

00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:04.900
Now, I'm going to
give you some stats, okay?

00:12:04.967 --> 00:12:09.333
So "Friends," you made
236 episodes of the show.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.467
It aired in
over 220 territories.

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:18.100
"Friends" was TV's number-one
comedy for six straight seasons,

00:12:18.167 --> 00:12:21.567
averaging 25 million viewers
a week.

00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:25.933
52 million people
watched the finale.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.667

over 100 billion times

- That's a lot.

- That's a lot.
- ...is a real

00:12:36.933 --> 00:12:39.500
celebration of that.

00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:42.867
And the creators of the show
are here tonight

00:12:42.933 --> 00:12:44.267
sat in the audience.

00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:49.000
Marta Kauffman, David Crane,
Kevin Bright are just sat there.

of "Friends."

Marta and I spent our 20s
living in New York.

00:13:24.067 --> 00:13:26.767
We had a tight
circle of friends.

00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:28.633
There we were in our 20s
in New York

trying to make a living
and find love.

00:13:32.833 --> 00:13:35.533
And we thought
that could be a show.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.767
We drew on relatives of ours
and friends of ours

00:13:38.833 --> 00:13:40.033
and names were...

00:13:40.100 --> 00:13:41.633
We named Chandler
after a friend of mine.

I mean, we definitely
pulled from our lives.

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:46.633
We really were intrigued
with the idea

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.267
of doing a true ensemble.

00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:50.833
It's not like there's a lead
and they have friends.

No, it's just about the friends.

all of their stories equally,

we hadn't seen before.

we had three per camera.

But you remember the beginning
of the week

00:15:20.733 --> 00:15:22.500
after the table draft,
you came to me and you go,

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:23.733
"It's so stupid."

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.233
I was like, "Yeah,
but that's the brilliance."

And you were like, "Maybe
we can have fun with this."

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.967
And then we had a blast.

00:15:29.033 --> 00:15:30.967

we can throw this ball
back and forth?

every meal together.

00:24:56.233 --> 00:24:59.567
but there was just too much
pressure, so... so I, uh...

00:24:59.633 --> 00:25:01.967
- I turned to Chandler.
- [MUFFLED SCREAM]

00:25:05.067 --> 00:25:08.167
Joey kept screaming at me,
"Do it, do it, do it now."

00:25:08.233 --> 00:25:11.833
Sometimes late at night,
I can still hear the screaming.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.633
That... That's 'cause sometimes
I just do it through the wall

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.400
to freak you out.

00:25:16.467 --> 00:25:17.533
And scene.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.200
You know, I was laughing
in that scene.

00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:21.100
Do you remember
the first table read ever?

00:25:21.167 --> 00:25:24.033
That's the first time
I laid eyes on any of you.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.800
I don't remember how...
I remember what you wore.

00:25:26.867 --> 00:25:29.367
- That's it.
- That's unbelievable.

00:25:29.433 --> 00:25:30.967
I don't remember
what the boys wore.

00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:32.667
I do remember what Courteney
and you wore.

00:25:32.733 --> 00:25:34.300
- That's it.
- What did I wear?

00:25:34.367 --> 00:25:38.867
- A white lacy hippie-ish blouse.
- Oh, I was trying to be Phoebe.

00:25:38.933 --> 00:25:40.433
You were being Phoebe.
And jeans.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.733
And Courteney had
a pink babydoll tee

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.533
from Fred Segal
with a white trim.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.233
Yeah, I just remember
that's when we all met

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.433
or I remember meeting everyone
the first time.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.867
You don't remember
what I was wearing?

00:25:51.933 --> 00:25:53.100
I don't remember what,

00:25:53.167 --> 00:25:56.100
but I do remember
you're the first person I saw.

00:25:56.167 --> 00:25:59.900
And I was like, "Oh, okay.
That's why I've been losing out

00:25:59.967 --> 00:26:01.467
on all of these roles
over these years.

00:26:01.533 --> 00:26:03.833
I mean, this is the good...
this is the hunk.

00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:05.667
You know, right here.
Of course he's Joey."

00:26:05.733 --> 00:26:08.600
And then hearing all of you
for the first time,

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:11.733
- I... that blew me away.
- That's what I remember.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.167
I just thought everyone
was so perfectly cast.

00:26:15.233 --> 00:26:17.800
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That's what I remember.

00:26:17.867 --> 00:26:19.967
Casting the show
was really hard,

00:26:20.033 --> 00:26:22.833
much more so than
I think we expected it to be.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:27.767
We saw approximately
a gazillion people.

00:26:27.833 --> 00:26:29.433
There are so many
different scenarios

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.433
where it wasn't going to be
these six people.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.133
It would have been
such a different show.

00:26:36.033 --> 00:26:38.967
We had seen David
for another role

00:26:39.033 --> 00:26:40.833
for a pilot
we'd done the year before.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:44.133
His hangdog expression
stuck with us.

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.067
So when we started doing Ross,
that was in our minds.

00:26:48.133 --> 00:26:51.567
Try to get David.
David has quit television.

00:26:51.633 --> 00:26:56.033
He's had a miserable experience
doing another show.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.667
He's moved back to Chicago
to just do theater.

00:26:58.733 --> 00:27:02.067
And we had to beg him
and beseech him.

00:27:02.133 --> 00:27:03.967
And "We wrote this for you."

00:27:04.033 --> 00:27:06.433
I believe we sent him
gift baskets.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.833
I have no recollection
of the gift basket.

00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:10.633
I thought we just
sent him the script.

00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.133
We assured him that whatever
his past experience was,

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.600
this was going to be different,
we promise.

00:27:14.667 --> 00:27:17.500
And he... he came on board.

00:27:17.567 --> 00:27:18.967
Alright, we got one.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.567
We saw a bunch of women
who read Phoebe,

00:27:24.633 --> 00:27:27.433
and it was nothing.

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:30.933
And meanwhile, my husband,
Jeffrey, was writing

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.567
and producing on
"Mad About You," and he said,

00:27:34.633 --> 00:27:37.600
"Phoebe is right here
playing Ursula the waitress."

00:27:37.667 --> 00:27:39.200
Here you go.

00:27:39.267 --> 00:27:41.267
- Can I get you anything else?
- No, thanks. We're fine.

00:27:41.333 --> 00:27:43.567
Okay, I'm just gonna go
get your check, then.

00:27:43.633 --> 00:27:46.500
- Got it right here.
- Great. Okay. Right.

00:27:46.567 --> 00:27:50.300
You could see a lot of the
beginnings of Phoebe there,

00:27:50.367 --> 00:27:52.600
but on "Mad About You,"
she had more of an edge.

00:27:52.667 --> 00:27:54.733
Phoebe was a much more
positive image.

00:27:57.233 --> 00:28:01.700
Lisa was someone who came in
and nailed the audition.

00:28:01.767 --> 00:28:04.500
She not only did
everything we'd hoped,

00:28:04.567 --> 00:28:06.500
she elevated the material.

00:28:06.567 --> 00:28:07.833
Lisa Kudrow was
the second one

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.200
to get cast in "Friends"
right after David.

00:28:10.267 --> 00:28:12.800
And that was at the beginning,
so we thought we were on a roll.

00:28:12.867 --> 00:28:14.667
And then came about
two and a half months

00:28:14.733 --> 00:28:16.400
where we cast no one.

00:28:20.033 --> 00:28:22.167
Matt LeBlanc,
if I remember correctly,

00:28:22.233 --> 00:28:25.500
had like $11 in his pocket
when he auditioned.

00:28:25.567 --> 00:28:29.900
Maybe it was $9,
but it wasn't a lot.

00:28:29.967 --> 00:28:33.500
We saw a lot of guys
who you believed were actors,

00:28:33.567 --> 00:28:37.867
guys who liked women,
but they weren't funny.

00:28:37.933 --> 00:28:43.567
Then Matt came in and suddenly
on him, the lines felt funny.

00:28:43.633 --> 00:28:44.967
He hadn't done an awful lot.

00:28:45.033 --> 00:28:47.600
He'd done another show,
but he hadn't done an awful lot.

00:28:47.667 --> 00:28:50.067
So Matt went right down
to the wire,

00:28:50.133 --> 00:28:53.667
auditioned at the network,
at NBC with another actor,

00:28:53.733 --> 00:28:56.500
and he killed it,
and he got the part as Joey.

00:28:56.567 --> 00:28:58.667
But the funny thing about it is

00:28:58.733 --> 00:29:00.700
the other actor ended up
in the show

00:29:00.767 --> 00:29:02.200
in "The One With the Unagi,"

00:29:02.267 --> 00:29:05.333
playing Fake Joey, ironically.

00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.800
How are you <i>doing?</i>

00:29:07.867 --> 00:29:10.833
No, no, no, no, no.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.000
How <i>you</i> doin'?

00:29:14.067 --> 00:29:16.233
How <i>you</i> doin'? Damn it, Carl.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.567
Go wait in the hall.

00:29:19.633 --> 00:29:21.900
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:29:21.967 --> 00:29:26.767
What do you remember
about the audition process?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.600
I remember I had gone in
a bunch of times,

00:29:31.667 --> 00:29:35.533
and I think it was
on the final callback.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:38.633
I had gone... I had gone with
a friend of mine to run lines

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.933
and he said, you know,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.133
"So the show's about friends
and being friends

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.300
with, you know,
just a group of friends?"

00:29:43.367 --> 00:29:44.367
I was like, "Yeah, kind of."

00:29:44.433 --> 00:29:47.333
He goes, "Then we should
go out drinking."

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.767
And I was like, "Yeah,
that's a good idea."

00:29:49.833 --> 00:29:52.267
So to make a long story short,

00:29:52.333 --> 00:29:54.433
I woke up in the middle
of the night at his apartment

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.767
and had to go to the bathroom,
and I got up too fast.

00:29:56.833 --> 00:29:58.500
And I can't believe
I'm telling this,

00:29:58.567 --> 00:30:02.933
but I kind of blacked out,
as you do,

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.100
and fell face first
into the toilet.

00:30:05.167 --> 00:30:08.167
And I hit my nose
on the bottom of the toilet seat

00:30:08.233 --> 00:30:12.600
and a huge, like, chunk of meat
came off my nose.

00:30:12.667 --> 00:30:14.067
And I'm looking in the mirror
and it's bleeding.

00:30:14.133 --> 00:30:15.933
I was like, "Oh, my God."

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.433
So I have to go in
for the big callback.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:21.200
And it's like a big,
ugly scab on my nose.

00:30:21.267 --> 00:30:24.700
And Marta Kauffman said,
"What happened to your face?"

00:30:24.767 --> 00:30:26.533
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.867
And I told the truth
and got the job so...

00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:31.533
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:37.067
- Look at that.
- Right? That's what happened.

00:30:37.133 --> 00:30:39.200
And, David,
I know that at the time,

00:30:39.267 --> 00:30:42.100
I think you were... you were
doing a lot of theater.

00:30:42.167 --> 00:30:45.333
What was it about "Friends"
that attracted you to it?

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.700
Marta and David made it clear
to me, made it known to me

00:30:48.767 --> 00:30:53.400
that they had written the role
of Ross with my voice in mind.

00:30:53.467 --> 00:30:55.167
And I was like,
"Well, I don't understand."

00:30:55.233 --> 00:30:58.133
- Ah, it's a bug. It's a bug.
- Oh, no!

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.100
- Is it gone?
- No, it's right there.

00:31:00.167 --> 00:31:02.433
[BLEEP]

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.767
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:03.833 --> 00:31:06.267
Aah! Oh, that's fuzz.
That's fuzz.

00:31:06.333 --> 00:31:07.733
That's alright.

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:10.033
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:13.467 --> 00:31:14.800
Was it real?

00:31:14.867 --> 00:31:17.100
- Is it gone?
- It's gone, it's gone.

00:31:17.167 --> 00:31:18.433
Can I just say...

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:22.467
The important thing is
that we dealt with it well.

00:31:22.533 --> 00:31:24.133
Yeah.

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.067
You even reacted to that
like Phoebe.

00:31:27.133 --> 00:31:28.367
That was great.

00:31:28.433 --> 00:31:30.567
That was much more
entertaining than my story.

00:31:30.633 --> 00:31:32.333
It really was.

00:31:35.733 --> 00:31:37.900
We were having a tough time
finding Monica,

00:31:37.967 --> 00:31:41.833
and we really saw Courteney
as kind of a Rachel at the time.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:45.033
We met with Courteney Cox,
and she explained to us

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.167
why she didn't think
she was a Rachel

00:31:47.233 --> 00:31:50.800
and that she herself
was more of a Monica.

00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:52.167
And she was right.

00:31:52.233 --> 00:31:57.800
Courteney brought this
incredible joy to the character.

00:31:57.867 --> 00:31:59.867
She'd been in
the Bruce Springsteen video

00:31:59.933 --> 00:32:02.267
and with Michael J. Fox
on "Family Ties."

00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:04.467
So people knew Courteney.

00:32:04.533 --> 00:32:08.167
Not enough so that it made it
the Courteney Cox show,

00:32:08.233 --> 00:32:09.300
which was always the fear.

00:32:09.367 --> 00:32:11.600
We didn't want stars.

00:32:11.667 --> 00:32:13.300
But everything
Courteney brought to it

00:32:13.367 --> 00:32:17.033
made Monica so much richer

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.000
than what we had
originally intended.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.333
I thought Chandler was gonna be
the easiest part to cast,

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.633
because he's not
just a character.

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:32.300
He's got jokes. He's got,
like, actual real jokes.

00:32:32.367 --> 00:32:34.867
So I thought, "Here we go.
This is gonna be great."

00:32:34.933 --> 00:32:39.900
And we saw actor after actor,
and it wasn't funny.

00:32:39.967 --> 00:32:42.467
We had worked with
Matthew Perry on "Dream On."

00:32:42.533 --> 00:32:47.200
And when Matthew reads
that dialogue, it sparkles

00:32:47.267 --> 00:32:49.567
and it comes alive.

00:32:49.633 --> 00:32:52.900
And for the first time
through the casting process,

00:32:52.967 --> 00:32:54.733
we knew there was
a character there

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:56.833
and that this was
the only guy to play it.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.533
There was just
a little problem.

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.667
He had already signed on
for another sitcom.

00:33:01.733 --> 00:33:07.167
It was about luggage handlers
in the future at LAX.

the last part we cast.

Jennifer had a similar problem
to Matthew in that

00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.200
she'd already signed on

00:34:25.267 --> 00:34:27.267

"Muddling Through."

That's right.

So what you have there
is a rare steak.

00:34:44.333 --> 00:34:47.400
And they had already shot
six episodes of this show,

00:34:47.467 --> 00:34:50.400
so it was a little bit more
than just the pilot.

00:34:50.467 --> 00:34:55.367
And we took this big risk
to cast her,

00:34:55.433 --> 00:34:57.000
share her with this other show

00:34:57.067 --> 00:34:58.767
and we'll see who wins.

00:34:58.833 --> 00:35:01.267
And we even shot
not only the pilot,

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:05.067
but probably three
episodes of "Friends"

00:35:05.133 --> 00:35:07.633
while that show
was still on television.

00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:11.033
And if it had...
if CBS had picked it up,

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.267
we would have had to reshoot

00:35:12.333 --> 00:35:15.400
the first three episodes
of "Friends."

and sincerity

00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:23.900

where she just made you feel

00:35:23.967 --> 00:35:26.333

that Rachel was

that you might have
passed judgment on.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.100
when you finally got
to meet them,

00:35:50.167 --> 00:35:52.533
when it was made clear
that you could do the show?

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.600
Well, first of all, I had
a graveyard of failed pilots.

00:35:56.667 --> 00:35:58.000
I did a pilot a year
and I thought,

00:35:58.067 --> 00:35:59.233
"That's what you do.

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.533
You do a pilot a year
and you have some cash.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.700
And then you go on
to another pilot."

00:36:03.767 --> 00:36:07.167
And I just remember sitting
with these five other people

00:36:07.233 --> 00:36:08.533

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.867
"This is the greatest
group of people,

00:36:11.933 --> 00:36:13.300
the greatest script.

00:36:13.367 --> 00:36:15.333

in second position,

some leaks up there.

00:41:15.767 --> 00:41:18.767
I had to call the roofer and
have them come over and fix it.

00:41:18.833 --> 00:41:22.900
The fact is,
like, no one was going through

what we were going through
except the other five.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.100
So I think that was really...

00:41:27.167 --> 00:41:29.000
So there's no shoulders
outside of this group

00:41:29.067 --> 00:41:30.800
to sort of go,
"Oh, this is so ..."

00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:33.000
And I think
it kind of created...

00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:34.867

our neural pathways

this sort of, like,
we are actually family.

00:41:37.433 --> 00:41:39.233
Yeah. Because our family
couldn't relate.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.467

couldn't relate.

My family was more starstruck
about it than we were.

But the only other people who
really knew what it was like

00:41:49.933 --> 00:41:51.367
were the other five.

when we were in first year

We were too shy
to talk to girls,

00:44:03.233 --> 00:44:06.867
so "Friends" was a way
to boost our morale

But I mean, as a woman, you have
to take control of your life.

got me thinking

00:44:40.067 --> 00:44:44.867

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:28.100
We'd have to go again
because the monkey

00:49:28.167 --> 00:49:30.333
- didn't get it right.
- David's so angry still.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.867
So this kept happening
over and over

00:49:32.933 --> 00:49:35.333
where we're about to do
something really funny.

00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.733
But the monkey
didn't hit its mark,

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:38.233
so we have to start again.

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:40.367
I would like you to be
more serious about this.

00:49:40.433 --> 00:49:42.067
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:42.133 --> 00:49:44.967
That combined... See, you
didn't have to deal with it.

00:49:45.033 --> 00:49:49.033
And that combined with
when the monkey was resting

00:49:49.100 --> 00:49:51.333
and just waiting for,
you know, for us to roll,

00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:54.467
it would sit on my shoulder
and the trainer would come up

00:49:54.533 --> 00:49:59.800
and just open and give... give
the monkey live grubs to eat.

00:49:59.867 --> 00:50:03.300
So the monkey... the monkey
would be sitting on my shoulder,

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:05.733
take some grubs...
take some grubs,

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:08.267
like, break them in half,
these squirming, live...

00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:11.433
then eat it, and then he'd just
go like that.

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:16.133
So I'd have monkey grubby hands
all over, all over.

00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:20.133
And it just wasn't... it was...
it was time for Marcel to...

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.100

some good answers there.

Alright. Okay. Let's go...

00:50:33.967 --> 00:50:36.133
I think
we've got another question.

00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.000
Yes. There's a couple here
in the audience here.

00:50:39.067 --> 00:50:40.833
Do you have a question?

00:50:40.900 --> 00:50:42.600

Eliot, Christina,
I'm keen to know,

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.800
what do you remember
about that time?

00:50:58.867 --> 00:51:01.467
I remember they were
awfully nice to us.

00:51:01.533 --> 00:51:03.933
Very down-to-earth,
real people.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.033
We loved it
because they loved us.

00:51:06.100 --> 00:51:09.400
And one day we came to work
and they said,

00:51:09.467 --> 00:51:11.867
"The parents are here,
the parents are here."

00:51:11.933 --> 00:51:13.667
And it was so moving.

00:51:13.733 --> 00:51:15.867
And we really did feel
like their parents.

00:51:15.933 --> 00:51:19.233
In fact, we used to worry
about them quite a lot.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:20.633
And Elliott said to me,

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.867
"We're behaving like
we're really their parents,"

00:51:22.933 --> 00:51:26.533
and we really did feel we were
because they're so sweet.

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:29.133
- We love you.
- That's incredibly sweet.

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:31.400
Thank you so much
for being here tonight.

00:51:31.467 --> 00:51:33.800
Fantastic.

I'd have to say,
I'm most like Monica

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.333
because I'm a clean freak.

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.667
You know, I travel a lot

00:51:48.733 --> 00:51:51.367

I've always got downtime.

When I'm missing the kids,
when I'm missing the family,

00:51:55.033 --> 00:51:57.533
I put on "Friends"
because it makes me smile.

00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:01.267
Orange juice
and what looks like cider.

00:52:01.333 --> 00:52:03.733
My favorite episode has to be

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.467
where they're all getting ready
in the apartment.

00:52:06.533 --> 00:52:09.033
It's fat. I drank fat.

Ross is hurrying everyone up

00:52:10.567 --> 00:52:14.433
because he has a huge speech
to make, and he's nervous.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.700
- Why aren't you guys dressed?
- We have a half-hour.

00:52:16.767 --> 00:52:18.400
When Chandler
goes to the toilet,

00:52:18.467 --> 00:52:20.533
Joey sits in Chandler's chair,

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:22.800
and then he comes back
and it all escalates.

00:52:22.867 --> 00:52:25.500
- You're in my seat.
- How is this your seat?

00:52:25.567 --> 00:52:29.000
- Because I was sitting there.
- But then you left.

00:52:29.067 --> 00:52:31.667
Well, it's not like
I went to Spain.

00:52:31.733 --> 00:52:34.100
Joey eventually
gives up his seat,

00:52:34.167 --> 00:52:35.633
but he takes the cushions
with him.

00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:36.833
What are you doing?

00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:38.267
Well, you said I had
to give you the chair.

00:52:38.333 --> 00:52:40.600
You didn't say anything
about the cushions.

00:52:40.667 --> 00:52:42.533
The cushions are the essence
of the chair.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:45.967
That's right.
I'm taking the essence.

00:52:46.033 --> 00:52:48.233
It's one of those episodes
that when I'm away

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:49.700
and when I'm feeling
a little bit low,

00:52:49.767 --> 00:52:51.067
I just put it on

00:52:51.133 --> 00:52:54.067
and it makes me smile
to almost the point of crying.

You hide my clothes,
I'm wearing everything you own.

- Oh, my God.
- Look at me, I'm Chandler.

00:53:06.867 --> 00:53:11.233
Could I be wearing
any more clothes?

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.900
Maybe if I wasn't
going commando.

Some of that was you had
to do some bottle shows.

You had to do shows that weren't
gonna cost a fortune

just on our sets

you put everybody in one room?

were fighting over the chair.

and announce that again.

not to jump on the bed.

So we had to put that
into the show,

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.367
but we waited
until he was okay again

00:56:28.433 --> 00:56:32.133
to film the ending of "The One
Where No One Was Ready."

00:56:32.200 --> 00:56:33.467

you did it

- jumping up and down on your bed?
- No.

ended up taking the longest
amount of time to shoot.

There was one thing
that we did every show

00:56:47.267 --> 00:56:49.433
that we didn't do that night
before we started.

- Why didn't we do it?
- I don't know.

I just happened to be

Whoa.

01:10:24.733 --> 01:10:27.533
I think one of the reasons
"Friends" is so funny

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.600
is the fact that
these six actors

01:10:29.667 --> 01:10:32.067
are masters of physical comedy.

01:10:32.133 --> 01:10:33.900
- Ohh.
- Ohh.

01:10:33.967 --> 01:10:35.767
There's a scene
with David Schwimmer

01:10:35.833 --> 01:10:38.533
where Ross has decided
not to pay for

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:40.667
the delivery service of a sofa,

01:10:40.733 --> 01:10:43.167

up the stairs

01:10:43.233 --> 01:10:45.333

everyone gets into trouble.

anymore.

starts telling them to pivot.

Here we go, pivot.

that scene is it's so simple.

If you were to see it
on the page initially,

01:11:19.867 --> 01:11:23.000
it's three actors carrying
a couch up the stairwell.

01:11:23.067 --> 01:11:25.800
There's maybe
a page of dialogue,

01:11:25.867 --> 01:11:28.633
and nothing really in that
dialogue suggests

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.600
anything massively comic.

is taping the last episode

01:30:51.967 --> 01:30:53.300
of their historic sitcom.

01:30:53.367 --> 01:30:54.567
Here I am
on the set of "Friends"

01:30:54.633 --> 01:30:56.533
in Monica
and Chandler's apartment,

01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:01.667
where in just hours, the show
that made TV must-see must end.

01:31:01.733 --> 01:31:04.767
If the show was about
that time in your life

01:31:04.833 --> 01:31:06.433
when your friends
are your family,

01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:09.400
once you have family
of your own,

01:31:09.467 --> 01:31:11.300
it's no longer that time.

01:31:11.367 --> 01:31:14.533
So the show came,
I think, to a natural end.

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:19.933
It was really important for us
to end everyone in a good place.

01:31:22.867 --> 01:31:25.167
We wanted to know
that Monica and Chandler

01:31:25.233 --> 01:31:27.300

Well, tell me which one.

01:31:40.933 --> 01:31:43.033
There was some discussion
in the writers room

01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:46.500
about do we really want
Ross and Rachel to get together?

- I'm so sorry.
