00:21:16.316 --> 00:21:17.692
[CHUCKLES]

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.778
- Mrs. Bing.
- Mr. Geller.

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.201
Hey.

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.621
You mean that?

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:33.457
Yeah, why not?

00:21:35.168 --> 00:21:36.877
- So I told her.
- Oh.

00:21:37.587 --> 00:21:39.588
- How did it go?
- Awful. Awful.

00:21:39.756 --> 00:21:41.674
Couldn't have gone worse.

00:21:42.426 --> 00:21:45.261
- Well, how do you feel?
- Pretty good.

00:21:47.347 --> 00:21:48.848
I told her.

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:51.017
Well, see?

00:21:51.184 --> 00:21:55.354
So maybe it wasn't such a bad idea,
you know, me kissing your mom, huh?

00:21:55.522 --> 00:21:58.024
But we don't have to go down that road.

00:22:04.698 --> 00:22:06.657
Now, this is just the first chapter...

00:22:06.825 --> 00:22:11.954
...and I want your absolute
honest opinion. Okay?

00:22:12.205 --> 00:22:16.834
Oh, and on page two, he's not reaching
for her "heaving beasts."

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:18.961
What's a "niffle"?

00:22:19.212 --> 00:22:22.131
You can usually find them
on the heaving beasts.

00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:26.510
All right, all right,
so I'm not a great typist.

00:22:26.678 --> 00:22:30.723
Wait, did you get to the part
about his "huge, throbbing pens"?

00:22:31.558 --> 00:22:34.810
Tell you, you don't wanna be around
when he starts writing with those.

00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:38.105
- All right, that's it. Give them back.
GROUP: No.
