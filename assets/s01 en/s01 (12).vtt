00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:01.652
Yes. And that would be a shutdown.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:03.112
[IN UNISON]
Shutout!

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:09.118
Where you guys going?
Come on, one more game.

00:22:09.286 --> 00:22:12.621
- Oh. It's 2:30 in the morning.
- Yeah. Get out.

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:16.000
You guys are always hanging out
in my apartment.

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:18.711
Come on, I'll only use my left hand,
huh?

00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:20.963
Come on, wussies.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.386
- All right. Okay. I gotta go.
- Mm-hm.

00:22:27.554 --> 00:22:28.971
I'm going.

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:30.931
And I'm gone.

00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:35.186
- One more game?
- Oh, yeah.
