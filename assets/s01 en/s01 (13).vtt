You just barge in here

- No, you wait.

- What? What?

Hey, Dad. Ronni's here.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.626
Hello, babe.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.796
What are...? What are you doing here?

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:15.757
Oh, uh, you left your hair
at my apartment.

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:18.385
I figured you'd need it
for your meeting.

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.263
Thank you. Uh...

00:11:24.392 --> 00:11:26.851
So who's up for a big
game of Kerplunk?

Look, I, uh...

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:34.317
I shouldn't have come.

00:11:34.568 --> 00:11:36.986
I gotta go.
I'll miss the last train.

No, I don't want you taking
that thing this late.

- Where am I gonna stay? Here?
- Whoa.

We'll go to a hotel.

- No, you won't.
- No, we won't.

If you go to a hotel,
you'll be doing stuff.

00:11:53.796 --> 00:11:56.756
I want you right here,
where I can keep an eye on you.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.633
You're gonna keep an eye on us?

That's right, mister.

I don't care how old you are,
while you're here...

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.265
...you're gonna live by my rules.

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:11.771
And that means no sleeping
with your girlfriend.

Wow, he's strict.

00:12:15.568 --> 00:12:16.776

Thanks.
You're a good kid.

Come on.
I'll show you to my room.

00:12:26.579 --> 00:12:30.498
That sounds weird when it's not
followed by, "No, thanks, it's late."

00:12:34.712 --> 00:12:38.131
Okay. This is just for tonight.
Starting tomorrow, you gotta change.

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:40.884
- Six years is long enough.
- What kind of change?

00:12:41.135 --> 00:12:43.094
- Break up with Ronni...
- I can't.

00:12:43.345 --> 00:12:45.972
Then come clean with Ma.
This is not right.

Hey, kickie.

- I can't sleep in my underwear.
- Well, you're gonna.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:21.382
I've been thinking...

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:24.928
...about how I'm always
seeing girls on top of girls.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:31.184
Are they end-to-end,
or tall, like pancakes?

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:34.771
You know what I mean.
How I date all these women.

00:13:35.022 --> 00:13:37.857
I always figured, when
the right one comes along...

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:41.402
...I'll be able to be a standup guy
and go the distance, you know?

00:13:41.612 --> 00:13:44.030
Now I'm looking at my Dad thinking...

You're not him, you're you.

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:51.412
When they wanted you to go into
your father's business, did you cave?

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:52.705
- No.
- No.

00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:55.250
You decided to go into
the out-of-work-actor business.

00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:59.587
That wasn't easy, but you did it.

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:03.216
And I believe that
when the right woman comes along...

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:05.343
...you'll have the guts to say:

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:06.970
"No thanks, I'm married."

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:14.978

Even if you know better...

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.473
...you gotta let them make
their own mistakes.

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:08.724
And just think...

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:11.060
...in a couple years,
we get to turn into them.

00:21:11.311 --> 00:21:12.687
Oh, please.

00:21:12.938 --> 00:21:15.523
If I turn into my parents,
I'll either be an alcoholic blond...

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:18.776
...chasing after 20-year-old boys...

00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:20.820
...or I'll end up like my mom.

00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:26.867
- Hey.
ALL: Hey, Pheebs.

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:28.536
MONICA:
How's it going?

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:32.039
Okay, except I broke up with Roger.

00:21:32.291 --> 00:21:33.791
ALL:
Oh.

00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:35.126
Yeah, right.

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:37.920
ALL:
No, no, really. Aw.

00:21:39.214 --> 00:21:42.925
- What happened?
- Ugh. I don't know. I mean...

00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:44.635
He's a good person...

00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:46.762
...and he can be really sweet.

00:21:47.389 --> 00:21:50.266
And in some ways,
I think he is so right for me.

00:21:50.517 --> 00:21:52.935
It's just, I hate that guy.

00:22:00.652 --> 00:22:03.112
Hey, Joey. What's going on?

00:22:03.363 --> 00:22:05.990
Clear the tracks for the boobie
payback express.

00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:08.034
Next stop, Rachel Green.

00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:12.997
[MONICA &amp; JOEY YELL]

00:22:14.374 --> 00:22:16.751
Joey, what the hell were you doing?

00:22:17.252 --> 00:22:19.545
Sorry, wrong boobies.

00:22:32.768 --> 00:22:33.893
Hello, Joey.

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:36.645
Hello, dear.
