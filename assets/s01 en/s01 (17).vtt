00:19:50.397 --> 00:19:53.107
Um, then, yeah, it's because of Phoebe.

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:57.278
So you know, it's either her or me.

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:01.866
Then, uh... Then I'm sorry.

00:20:06.496 --> 00:20:08.080
You know...

00:20:08.248 --> 00:20:10.625
...you're gonna be
really, really hard to get over.

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:12.501
I know.

00:20:18.717 --> 00:20:23.137
I don't know whether it's just
because we're breaking up or what...

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:25.389
...but you have never
looked so beautiful.

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.099
Really?

00:20:57.965 --> 00:20:59.423
- Pheebs?
- Yeah.

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:11.394
He looks so tiny.

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:14.814
- We just got the message.
- Is he all right?

00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:17.358
Yeah, the doctor got the K out.

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:20.319
He also found an M and an O.

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:25.074
We think he was trying
to spell out "monkey."

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:34.875
The doctor says he'll be fine.
He's just sleeping now.

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.337
So you feel like a dad yet?

00:21:38.588 --> 00:21:40.339
No. Why?

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:44.343
Hey, come on, you came through.
You did what you had to do.

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:46.053
That is very dad.

00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:47.763
Oh, look, he's waking up.

00:21:48.098 --> 00:21:50.558
ROSS:
Hey, fella. How you doing?

00:22:10.037 --> 00:22:14.874
[DUBBED IN SPANISH]

00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:21.672
ALL:
Ooh.
