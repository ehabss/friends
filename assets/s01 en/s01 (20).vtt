00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:57.296
Yeah.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.590
Really?

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:01.592
Yeah.

00:21:01.969 --> 00:21:04.512
You know, ever since I ran out on Barry
at the wedding...

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.640
...I have wondered
whether I made the right choice.

00:21:07.808 --> 00:21:10.059
Oh. And now I know.

00:21:11.144 --> 00:21:12.853
MONICA:
I'm so glad.

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.776
Big day.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:30.621
All right, I'll give you this:
Mr. Peanut is a better dresser.

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:33.833
I mean, he's got the monocle,
he's got the top hat...

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.876
Did you know he's gay?

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:43.092
I just wanna clarify this.
Are you outing Mr. Peanut?

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:47.054
- Chandler?
- Danielle, hi.

00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:49.765
Everybody, this is Danielle.
Danielle, everybody.

00:21:49.933 --> 00:21:51.142
GROUP:
Hi.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.728
- What are you doing here?
- I've been calling you...

00:21:53.895 --> 00:21:55.938
...but it turns out
I had your number wrong.

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:59.442
And when I finally got the right one
from Information, there was no answer.

00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:02.611
So I thought I'd just come down here
and make sure you were okay.

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:05.406
Oh, uh, I'm okay.

00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:08.117
Listen, uh, maybe we could
get together later?

00:22:08.618 --> 00:22:11.620
That sounds good. I'll call you.
Or you call me, whatever.

00:22:11.788 --> 00:22:12.955
- You know.
- Ha, ha.

00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:14.498
- You got it.
CHANDLER: Okay.

00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:16.584
- Bye, everybody.
GROUP: Bye.

00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:20.046
Woo-hoo! Yeah, there you go.

00:22:20.213 --> 00:22:22.006
Second date.

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:23.924
I don't know.

00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:25.301
RACHEL:
You don't know?

00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:29.221
Oh, she seems nice, but that thing
about her coming all the way here...

00:22:29.389 --> 00:22:32.808
...just to see if I was okay?
I mean, how needy is that?

00:22:32.976 --> 00:22:34.685
