- Hi, guys.
JOEY: Hey, Phoebe.

00:00:07.632 --> 00:00:08.924
Hey, oh, how did it go?

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:10.175
Um, not so good.

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:13.178
He walked me to the subway and said,
"We should do this again."

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:16.056
- Ouch.
- What? He said, "We should do it again."

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.307
That's good, right?

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:20.602
Uh, no. Loosely translated,
"We should do this again," means:

00:00:20.812 --> 00:00:22.855
"You will never see me naked."

00:00:24.065 --> 00:00:25.274
Since when?

00:00:25.483 --> 00:00:28.819
Since always. It's, like, dating language.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.239
You know, like, "It's not you,"
means, "It is you."

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:34.992
"You're such a nice guy," means:

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.161
"I'm gonna be dating
leather-wearing alcoholics...

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.788
...and complaining about them to you."

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:43.292
Or, you know, um, "I think we should see
other people," means:

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.002
"Ha, ha, I already am."

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:47.880
And everybody knows this?

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:50.049
Oh, yeah. Cushions the blow.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.801
Like when you're a kid
and your parents put your dog to sleep...

00:00:53.011 --> 00:00:55.429
...and they tell you it went off
to live on some farm.

00:00:55.638 --> 00:00:58.682
That's funny.
No, because, uh, our parents actually did...

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.393
...uh, send our dog off to live on a farm.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:04.313
Uh, Ross?

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:08.567
Ha, ha. Hello.
The Milner's farm in Connecticut?

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:11.195
The Milners,
they had this unbelievable farm.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:13.947
They had horses and rabbits
that he could chase.

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:15.991
And it was...

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.954
Oh, my God. Chi-Chi.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:18.095
CHANDLER: "So how does it feel
knowing you're about to die?"

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:21.640
Warden, in five minutes
my pain will be over.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.728
But you'll have to live with the knowledge
that you sent an honest man to die.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.648
- Hey, that was really good.
- Yeah?

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:31.191
- Yeah.
- Thanks. Let's keep going.

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:36.238
Okay. "So, what do you want
from me, Dimon? Huh?"

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:42.661
I just wanna go back to my cell,
because in my cell, I can smoke.

00:02:42.871 --> 00:02:44.621
"Smoke away."

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:53.964
Heh.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.384
[COUGHING]

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:01.513
I think this is probably why Dimon
smokes in his cell alone.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:04.391
- What?
- Relax your hand.

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:06.351
Let your wrist go.

00:03:06.561 --> 00:03:07.603
- Not so much.
- Whoa.

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.062
Hey.

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.107
All right. Now try taking a puff.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:13.984
Right.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:19.239
- Okay, no, give it to me.
- No, no, no. I'm not giving you a cigarette.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.784
No, it's fine. It's fine. Look, do you want
to get this part or not? Here.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.622
All right. Now, don't think
of it as a cigarette.

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:30.834
Think of it as the thing
that has been missing from your hand.

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.962
When you're holding it, you feel right.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:36.506
- You feel complete.
- You miss it?

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.342
No, not so much.

00:03:40.094 --> 00:03:42.346
All right. Now we smoke.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.601
Oh, my God.

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:56.693
No, no, no.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:04:00.072
They say it's the same as the distance
from the tip of a guy's thumb...

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:01.907
...to the tip of his index finger.

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:10.290
That's ridiculous.

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.168
Can I use either thumb?

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:17.589
All right. Don't tell me, don't tell me.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:21.260
Decaf cappuccino for Joey.

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:24.972
Coffee, black.

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.307
Latte.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:30.602
And an iced tea.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.231
- I'm getting pretty good at this.
- Excellent. That's very good.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.857
Good for me.

00:04:45.034 --> 00:04:46.451
[MUMBLING]

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.457
- You okay, Phoebe?
- Yeah, no, it's not even worth...

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:54.001
It's my bank.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.460
What did they do to you?

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.504
It's nothing, it's just... Okay.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.340
I'm going through my mail,
and I open up their monthly "statement."

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.009
Easy.

00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.680
And there's 500 extra dollars
in my account.

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.142
Oh, Satan's minions at work again.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:13.312
Yes, because now I have to go down there
and deal with them...

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.732
- What are you talking about? Keep it.
- It's not mine.

00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:19.568
I didn't earn it.
If I kept it, it would be like stealing.

00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:23.363
Yeah, but if you spent it,
it would be like shopping.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:25.699
Okay. Okay.

00:05:25.908 --> 00:05:27.993
Let's say I bought
a really great pair of shoes.

00:05:28.202 --> 00:05:30.495
Do you know what I'd hear
with every step I took?

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:33.123
"Not mine. Not mine. Not mine."

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:36.168
And even if I was happy, okay,
and skipping...

00:05:36.377 --> 00:05:39.546
...I'd hear, "Not mine. Not mine."

We're with you. We got it.

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:46.636
Okay, I'd never be able to enjoy it.
It'd be like this giant karmic debt.

00:05:46.846 --> 00:05:49.222
Chandler, what are you doing? Hey.

00:05:49.432 --> 00:05:51.266
What are you doing?

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.355
Oh, gross.

00:05:57.065 --> 00:05:59.399
- What is this?
- I'm smoking. I'm smoking. I'm smoking.

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:02.194
I can't believe you.
You've been so good for three years.

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:04.988
And this is my reward.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:09.659
Hold on a second. Just think about what
you went through the last time you quit.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.745
Okay, so this time I won't quit.

00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:14.456
- Put it out.
- All right. I'm putting it out.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.376
Oh, no.

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.544
I can't drink this now.

All right, I'm gonna go change.
I've got a date.

Is this Alan again? How's it going?

It's going pretty good, you know?
It's nice and we're having fun.

- So when do we get to meet the guy?

- Never.

Sorry.

Why should I let them meet him?

00:07:03.381 --> 00:07:06.299
I bring a guy home and within five minutes
they're all over him.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:10.345
I mean, they're like coyotes picking off
the weak members of the herd.

Listen, as someone who's seen
more than her share of bad beef...

...I'll tell you, that is not
such a terrible thing.

Come on, they're your friends.
They're looking out after you.

00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:25.652
I know, I know. I wish that once I'd
bring a guy home they actually liked.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:29.573
Well, you do realize that the odds
of that happening are a little slimmer...

00:07:29.782 --> 00:07:31.616
...if they never get to meet the guy.

00:07:33.578 --> 00:07:35.120
Let it go, Ross.

- We won!
- We won! Thank you! Yeah.

Fantastic. I have one question:
How is that possible?

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:11.002
- Alan.
- He was unbelievable.

00:11:11.212 --> 00:11:14.756
He was like that Bugs Bunny cartoon
where Bugs is playing all the positions.

00:11:14.965 --> 00:11:18.426
But instead of Bugs, it was first base, Alan.
Second base, Alan...

00:11:22.056 --> 00:11:25.475
I mean, it was like he made us
into a team.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.686
Yep. We sure showed
those Hasidic jewelers...

00:11:27.895 --> 00:11:30.522
...a thing or two about softball.
- Nice.

Can I ask you guys a question?

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:36.111
Do you ever think that Alan
is maybe sometimes...

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:40.281
- What?
- I don't know. A little too Alan?

00:11:40.491 --> 00:11:43.910
Oh, no. That's not possible.
You can never be too Alan.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.832
Yeah, it's his innate Alan-ness
that we adore.

00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:51.376
- I, personally, could have a gallon of Alan.
- Oh!

00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:00.218
- Hey, Lizzy.
- Hey, Weird Girl.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:03.138
- I brought you alphabet soup.
- Did you pick out the vowels?

00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:06.349
Yes, but I left in the Y's.
Because, you know, "Sometimes Y."

00:12:07.143 --> 00:12:08.768

Oh, my God.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:20.196
- Oh, my God. There's really money in here.
- I know.

00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:24.242
Oh, I want you to have it. I don't want it.

00:12:24.952 --> 00:12:27.412
No, no. I have to give you something.

00:12:27.621 --> 00:12:29.247
No, it's fine. You don't...

00:12:29.457 --> 00:12:31.374
Do you want my tinfoil hat?

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:34.461
No, because you need that.
No, it's okay. Thanks.

- Oh, hey, don't do that. Come on.
- Cut that out.

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:25.947

- So I have a flaw. Big deal.

isn't annoying?

every single word.

Huh.

00:15:08.449 --> 00:15:13.119
Well, is it, like, a little annoying? Or
is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?

00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:19.083
