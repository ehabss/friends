Terry, I know I haven't worked here
very long...

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.470
...but I was wondering,
do you think it would be possible...

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:16.724
...if I got a $100 advance on my salary?

An advance?

this whole independent thing, you know...

ROSS:
Mm.

00:22:00.485 --> 00:22:02.611
And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:04.071
And a crappy New Year.

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:06.532

Hear, hear.
