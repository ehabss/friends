WEBVTT

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:05.838
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:09.508
Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree.

00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:13.012
Oh, my God, you should see the size
of his Christmas balls!

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.474
Hey.
Hey.

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:19.351
How much did you tip the super?

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.896
Yeah, we were gonna give 50,
but we don't wanna look bad.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.232
Oh, this year
we just made him cookies.

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:27.609
And 25 it is.

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.654
Heh. You gave him cookies?

00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.740
- Money is so impersonal.
Yeah.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.700
Cookies says someone really cares.

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:38.746
All right, we're broke,
but cookies do say that.

00:00:39.914 --> 00:00:40.998
I can see that.

00:00:41.207 --> 00:00:43.292
A plate of brownies told me a limerick.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:50.049
Pheebs, let me ask you something.
Were these, uh, "funny" brownies?

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.509
Not especially.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.179
But, you know,
I think they had pot in them.

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:00.768
So, you guys, who else did you tip
with cookies?

00:01:00.935 --> 00:01:03.187
Uh, the mailman, the super...

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:07.191
Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy.

00:01:07.984 --> 00:01:09.526
Oh, my God.

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.111
What?

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.072
Uh, I don't think you're gonna like this.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.323
Oh, wow.

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:16.366
Oh, gosh.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.828
Oh, these are cookies
smashed in the Sports section.

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:21.955
And he did my crossword puzzle.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:25.918
Yeah, but not very well,
unless 14 across, "Gershwin musical"...

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:30.255
...actually is "Bite me, bite me, bite me. "

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:23.183
I can't believe it's Christmas already.
You know?

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:26.145
One day you're eating turkey,
the next thing you know...

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:29.314
...your lords are a-leaping
and your geese are a-laying. Heh.

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.945
Which is why geese are
so relaxed this time of year.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.615
- Hey, guys.
Hey.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:40.993
Hey, Rach.

00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:44.079
I, uh, got you a little present.

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.958
I'll open it.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.419
It's a Slinky!

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.713
Ha, ha. Remember, huh?

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:55.090
Walks downstairs
Alone or in pairs

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.134
Everyone knows it's...

00:02:58.887 --> 00:03:01.138
Just a big spring.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.932
You're still mad because of the whole...

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:06.518
Horrible list of reasons not to be with me?

00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:09.354
How about we just call it
"the unfortunate incident"?

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:15.736
Hey, Gunther.
You got stairs in your place?

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.197
- Yeah.
- Go nuts.

00:03:20.241 --> 00:03:21.700
- Hey, guys.
Hey.

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:24.119
What's in the bag?

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:26.496
Mm, just some presents.

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:28.707
Come on, show us what you bought.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.834
You know you want to.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.712
Okay.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:39.509
This is a picture frame
from Ben to my parents.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.261
Oh, that's cute.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:44.473
Some "Hers" and "Hers" towels
for Susan and Carol.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.979
And, uh, I got this blouse for Mom.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.232
- Ross, that is gorgeous!
- Yeah?

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.068
Look at these authentic fake medals!

00:03:56.236 --> 00:03:58.070
Mom's gonna be voted "best dressed"...

00:03:58.238 --> 00:04:00.364
...at the make-believe military academy!

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.660
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:07.955
- Happy Christmas Eve Eve.
- You too.

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:10.207
Oh, my God! Where did you get this?

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:13.085
Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings.

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:14.586
This is my father!

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:16.421
This is a picture of my dad!

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:22.552
Uh, Pheebs, that's the guy
that comes in the frame.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.972
No, it's my dad. I'll show you.

00:04:25.181 --> 00:04:27.391
I thought your dad was in prison.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.184
No, that's my stepdad.

00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:32.729
My real dad's the one that
ran out on us before I was born.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.898
How have you never been on Oprah?

00:04:36.818 --> 00:04:38.819
Look, see? This is him.

00:04:39.028 --> 00:04:42.656
My mother gave me this picture
before she died. Same guy!

00:04:45.743 --> 00:04:48.370
Honey, uh, this is a picture
of the frame guy...

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.248
...posing in front of a blue screen
with a collie.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:54.668
It's not a blue screen. It's just...

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.671
Maybe it was just really clear that day.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:03.093
Okay, I have to talk to my grandmother.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:06.305
Wait a minute, honey!
Pheebs.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.016
Whoa.
Wow.

00:05:10.476 --> 00:05:13.061
I'm trying to get my boss's
ex-wife to sleep with me.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.272
Joey.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.692
Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem,
everyone's all ears!

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.947
Esther Livingston.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:26.992
Gone!

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:30.704
Um... Hi, Pooh.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.165
Hi, Gram. Ahem, what you doing?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.876
Oh, just updating the phone book.

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:39.338
Um, Gram? Um...

00:05:39.505 --> 00:05:41.757
Can I see the pictures of my dad again?

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.759
Oh.

00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:45.010
Oh, sure, sure.

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:47.637
Uh... Huh, how come?

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:50.474
Just, you know, to see him.

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:52.642
Oh, sure. Here.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.061
All right, uh...

00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:57.230
This is the one
of your father in a meadow.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:01.818
And, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.447
And here he is at a graduation.

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:13.705
Another graduation.

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:16.750
Is this really my father?

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:18.919
Is it really your...?

00:06:20.713 --> 00:06:22.547
Well, of course it is.

00:06:23.341 --> 00:06:26.718
I smell smoke. Maybe because
someone's pants are on fire!

00:06:27.804 --> 00:06:28.845
Well, I...

00:06:29.013 --> 00:06:31.890
In all the years we've been
grandmother and granddaughter...

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.600
...you've never lied.

00:06:35.019 --> 00:06:39.272
All right, that's not your father.
It's a picture of a guy in a frame.

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:42.651
Oh, God.

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:45.654
It was your mother's idea.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:48.240
She didn't want you
to know your real father...

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:50.367
...because it hurt her so much when he left.

00:06:50.952 --> 00:06:52.577
I didn't wanna go along with it.

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:56.123
But then she died
and it was harder to argue with her.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.086
Not impossible, but harder.

00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.881
All right.
So he's not a famous tree surgeon?

00:07:09.303 --> 00:07:13.640
And I guess he doesn't live in a hut in Burma
where there's no phones?

00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:17.519
Last I heard, he was
a pharmacist somewhere upstate.

00:07:17.728 --> 00:07:19.312
That makes no sense.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.649
Why would the villagers
worship a pharmacist?

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.278
Honey.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.613
- Oh. Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:32.826
Anyway, that's all I know.

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:36.455
That...

00:07:38.166 --> 00:07:39.958
...and this.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.045
This...

00:07:45.006 --> 00:07:46.923
...is the real him.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.218
Oh.

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:55.056
I remember my father
all dressed up in the red suit...

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.393
...the big black boots
and the patent leather belt...

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:01.646
...sneaking around downstairs.
He didn't want us to see him...

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:06.526
...but he'd be drunk, so he'd crash
into something and wake everybody up.

00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:09.863
That doesn't sound like
a very merry Christmas.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.240
Who said anything about Christmas?

00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:17.871
- Hi.
- Anyone hear from Phoebe yet?

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.414
No, nothing.

00:08:19.582 --> 00:08:20.999
I hope she's okay.

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:23.168
I know exactly what she's going through.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:25.712
How do you know
what she's going through?

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:27.464
She told us.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.594
What do you got there, Monica?

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:34.054
Stuff for the party.

00:08:34.263 --> 00:08:37.140
Aren't you guys supposed to be shopping?

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:38.975
You didn't buy presents yet?

00:08:39.185 --> 00:08:41.853
Tomorrow's Christmas Eve!
What are you gonna do?

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:45.023
Don't you have to be Claymation
to say stuff like that?

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.861
Oh, by the way, Mon, I don't think
the mailman liked your cookies.

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:51.905
Here are the ornaments your mom sent.

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.243
Well...

00:08:56.452 --> 00:09:00.580
Maybe the mailman liked the cookies.
We just didn't give him enough.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.792
Monica, pigeons learn faster than you.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:13.093
Hey, Rach. Ahem.

00:09:13.261 --> 00:09:16.221
I think I know what will
make you feel better.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.224
How about you make a list about me?

00:09:19.392 --> 00:09:21.601
Forget it. I'm not gonna stand here...

00:09:21.811 --> 00:09:22.978
...and make a list.

00:09:23.187 --> 00:09:25.146
Okay, you're whiny...

00:09:25.356 --> 00:09:28.275
...you are obsessive, you are insecure...

00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:30.193
...you're gutless.
- Heh.

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.445
You don't ever just seize the day.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.657
You liked me for a year
and you didn't do anything about it.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:39.077
And, uh... Oh, you wear
too much of that gel in your hair.

00:09:43.791 --> 00:09:45.417
See, there. You, uh...

00:09:45.585 --> 00:09:47.168
All right, you did what I said.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.629
- And you know what?
- Hmm?

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:51.590
You're right. I do feel better.

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:52.841
Thank you, Ross.

00:09:58.889 --> 00:10:03.435
Yeah, in Albany. Could I have
the number of Frank Buffay?

00:10:04.562 --> 00:10:07.564
Okay. Um, in Ithaca?

00:10:08.399 --> 00:10:10.900
All right, um, Saratoga?

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:13.403
Oneonta?

00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:17.365
You know what?
You shouldn't call yourself Information!

00:10:22.413 --> 00:10:23.496
Hey.

00:10:23.664 --> 00:10:27.542
Hello, Grandma.
If that is, in fact, your real name.

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:31.921
Come on now, Pooh.
Don't still be mad at me.

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.383
- How's it going?
- Oh, not so good.

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:39.929
Upstate's pretty big.
He's pretty small. You do the math.

00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:43.600
Well, I think you're better off without him.

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:46.561
Oh, honey, I know he's your daddy.

00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:49.939
But to me,
he's still the irresponsible creep...

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:54.194
...who locked up your mom
and stole her Gremlin.

00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:59.366
I know. I just wanted to know
who he was, you know?

00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:02.452
Yeah, I know.

00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:05.205
Okay.

00:11:05.706 --> 00:11:09.709
I wasn't completely honest with you
when I told you that, uh, I didn't know...

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.170
...exactly where he lived.

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.130
What do you mean?

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:18.385
He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown.

00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:23.264
If you hit the Dairy Queen,
you've gone too far.

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:25.308
You can take my cab.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.851
Wow.

00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:28.311
Thank you.

00:11:29.897 --> 00:11:33.316
- Nobody else drives that cab.
- Uh-huh. Got it.

00:11:33.651 --> 00:11:34.734
Oh.

00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:37.237
- I'm gonna see my dad!
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:40.240
- Thank you.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

00:11:40.408 --> 00:11:41.866
Mm, okay. Oh.

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:44.369
Wish me luck, Grandpa.

00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:53.837
Hey.

00:11:54.004 --> 00:11:55.422
Phoebe here with the cab yet?

00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:58.258
Yeah, she brought the invisible cab.

00:11:58.426 --> 00:11:59.759
Hop in!

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:03.179
She'd better get here. The stores close at 7.

00:12:03.347 --> 00:12:06.224
It'll be two hours to Phoebe's dad's house...

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:08.518
...they'll meet, chat, swap life stories.

00:12:08.686 --> 00:12:10.353
We'll still have plenty of time.

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.732
- Hey, here she comes!
- Hey.

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:16.067
Hey, hey.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:18.069
Hi.

00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:21.698
Hey.
Hey.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:23.450
Can you believe this?

00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:25.952
In like two hours I'm gonna have a dad.

00:12:27.663 --> 00:12:29.247
Yeah, big stuff.

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.874
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:33.042
- Here, you have to hold this.
- Okay.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:38.506
"Brake, left. Gas, right"?

00:12:39.383 --> 00:12:40.717
Uh-huh, that's my cheat sheet.

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.307
- Where's my seat belt?
- That side doesn't have one.

00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:50.185
The paramedics had to cut through it.

00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:56.191
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:03.782
Come on, just tell me. Please, please.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:09.204
For the 16th time,
no, I do not think you're obsessive.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.583
- Oh, it's hot in here!
Rach, get the heat.

00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:16.503
- Ross, turn the heat down, please?
- Sure.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.838
There's a difference between obsessive...

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:20.173
Ross, the heat!

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:24.469
Okay. Heat, heat, heat.
And I'm the obsessive one?

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:26.429
Okay.

00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:28.348
This way is on.

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:31.476
So this is...

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.104
...off.

00:13:36.148 --> 00:13:38.358
Did you just break the radiator?

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:41.486
No, I was turning the knob and...

00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:43.446
...here it is.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:44.864
Well, put it back!

00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:48.952
It, uh...

00:13:49.119 --> 00:13:52.163
- It won't go back.
- Ugh. I'll call the super.

00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:53.790
Here, let me try.

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:58.169
Oh, oh, that's right.
I forgot about your ability to fuse metal.

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:00.129
Hey, it's Funny's cousin...

00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:01.422
...Not Funny!

00:14:01.632 --> 00:14:03.258
Hi, Mr. Treeger?

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:05.385
It's Rachel Green from upstairs.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.638
Yes, somebody, uh,
broke our knob on the radiator...

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.683
...and it's really hot in here.

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.853
Yes, it's hot enough to bake cookies.

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:19.983
Well, do you think
we could have a new one by 6?

00:14:20.526 --> 00:14:22.986
What? No, no. Tuesday?
We can't wait until Tuesday.

00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:24.946
We're having a party tonight.

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:26.447
Okay, tip the man.

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:28.533
If he doesn't like our cookies, too bad.

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.493
I won't be blackmailed.

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:32.954
Look, if it gets a little warm...

00:14:33.122 --> 00:14:34.831
...it can be a theme party.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.834
Here's a theme:
"Come on in, live like bacon!"

00:14:41.088 --> 00:14:42.338
Ooh, this is it.

00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:44.257
Seventy-four.

00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:48.261
Oh, so that's what this is for!

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:49.554
Wow.

00:14:49.763 --> 00:14:52.682
This is it. I'm gonna meet my dad.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:55.018
This is, like, the biggest thing ever, huh?

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:57.270
- Yeah.
- Sure is.

00:14:57.479 --> 00:14:59.147
Here I go. I'm going in.

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:00.398
All right!

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:01.858
Good luck, Pheebs.

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:03.610
Okay.

00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:09.157
Here I go.

00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:12.243
I'm going.

00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:25.381
Hi.

00:15:25.549 --> 00:15:27.967
Welcome to our tropical
Christmas party, heh.

00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:31.721
Put your coats, sweaters,
pants and shirts in the bedroom.

00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:36.601
It's hard to tell because I'm sweating...

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.854
...but I use exactly what the gel bottle says.

00:15:42.358 --> 00:15:46.778
An amount about the size of a pea.
How can that be too much?

00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:51.115
Ice?

00:15:51.283 --> 00:15:54.911
Ice? Ice squares anyone?
Take a napkin.

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:56.162
All right.

00:15:56.997 --> 00:15:58.247
Monica. Monica!

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:02.418
Monica, your guests are turning into jerky.

00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:04.754
Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.

00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:08.007
Ha, ha. Hey! Get in line, buddy.
I was next.

00:16:12.513 --> 00:16:13.972
Mr. Treeger.

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.556
You said there was a party.

00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:17.058
Oh, yeah.

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.810
Well, hey, welcome to our sauna.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:22.855
Uh, is it hot? My body always stays cool.

00:16:23.023 --> 00:16:25.483
Probably because I have so much skin.

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:28.194
Hey, cheese!

00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:32.615
Here's the chance.
Monica, give him cash.

00:16:32.825 --> 00:16:35.952
Rachel, give him your earrings.
Something. Anything!

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:37.704
No, I will not cave.

00:16:37.871 --> 00:16:38.955
I'm with Mon.

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:42.417
All right. You know how you say
I never seize the day?

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:46.004
Even though he's your super, I'm seizing.

00:16:47.881 --> 00:16:48.923
Mr. Treeger?

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.969
Here is 50 bucks. Merry Christmas.

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.387
Oh, wow.

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:55.638
I didn't get you anything.

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:59.017
Here's five back.

00:16:59.768 --> 00:17:02.562
No, that's your Christmas tip.

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:07.275
Oh, do you think there's a chance
you can fix that radiator now?

00:17:07.484 --> 00:17:09.736
No can do. Like I told the girl...

00:17:09.903 --> 00:17:11.738
...I can't get a knob until Tuesday.

00:17:12.531 --> 00:17:14.157
- Ross?
Yeah?

00:17:14.324 --> 00:17:16.075
He's playing baseball.

00:17:16.243 --> 00:17:18.077
You mean hardball?

00:17:21.415 --> 00:17:22.498
Whatever.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:24.333
What you gonna do?

00:17:24.501 --> 00:17:26.669
Excuse me. I'm seizing.

00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.880
Mr. Treeger?

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:31.215
Here's another 50.

00:17:31.383 --> 00:17:33.051
Happy Hanukkah.

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:36.345
Will, uh, this help with the knob-getting?

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:37.764
No.

00:17:37.931 --> 00:17:40.892
The place is not open till Tuesday.

00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:42.435
Am I not saying it right?

00:17:44.813 --> 00:17:47.106
So you really did like my cookies?

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:51.110
Oh, yeah, they were so personal.
It really showed you cared.

00:17:56.658 --> 00:17:58.326
Nice seizing...

00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:00.411
...gel boy.

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:04.624
So, uh...

00:18:04.833 --> 00:18:06.751
Is this, uh, mistletoe?

00:18:08.796 --> 00:18:10.421
No, uh, that...

00:18:10.672 --> 00:18:12.882
That is basil.

00:18:14.384 --> 00:18:16.052
- Oh.
- Yeah.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:19.222
If it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss you.

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:23.184
No, it's still basil.

00:18:36.824 --> 00:18:38.074
Okay.

00:18:39.493 --> 00:18:40.868
- How far did you get?
- Mailbox.

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:44.080
- All right, we're getting closer.
- Uh-huh.

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:46.666
What's going on?

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:50.294
It's just, like, a whole mess of stuff.

00:18:50.462 --> 00:18:55.049
Like yesterday, my dad was
this famous Burma tree-surgeon guy.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.719
And, you know, now he's, uh,
a pharmacist guy and...

00:18:58.929 --> 00:19:03.057
Well, maybe he's this
really cool pharmacist guy.

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:07.645
Yeah, maybe. And I'll knock on the door...

00:19:07.813 --> 00:19:11.065
...and he'll hug me, and I'll have a dad.

00:19:11.275 --> 00:19:14.902
I'll go to his pharmacy
and everyone will be nice to me...

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.072
...because, you know,
I'm Frank's daughter.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.615
So why not go knock?

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:28.499
Because, I mean,
what if he's not this great dad guy?

00:19:29.042 --> 00:19:33.754
What if he's still the dirtbag
who ran out on my mom and us?

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:37.508
- Yeah.
Hmm.

00:19:38.635 --> 00:19:40.052
You know what?

00:19:40.679 --> 00:19:43.681
I've already lost a fake dad this week.

00:19:44.892 --> 00:19:47.768
I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:53.566
Pheebs, that's okay.
You took a big step today.

00:19:54.651 --> 00:19:56.319
- Yeah?
Yeah.

00:19:56.486 --> 00:20:00.031
Someday, when you're ready,
you'll make it past the hedges.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.075
And when you do,
he'll be lucky to have you.

00:20:04.119 --> 00:20:05.828
You guys.

00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:11.334
Sorry about your shopping.

00:20:11.501 --> 00:20:14.962
Oh, that's okay. We'll figure something out.

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:19.383
I know you're not going in there...

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:23.095
...but do you think it'd be all right
if I went in and used his bathroom?

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:26.515
That's fine, never mind.

00:20:27.684 --> 00:20:29.227
Cool, snow!

00:20:29.436 --> 00:20:31.938
Kind of like a blank canvas.

00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:44.533
Ho-ho-ho-holy crap, is it hot in here!

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.038
You mind if I turn the heat down?

00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:52.625
We could have used
that kind of thinking earlier!

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:54.669
So, Pheebs, how did it go?

00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:56.921
Oh, ahem, I couldn't go in.

00:20:57.089 --> 00:20:59.257
Honey, I'm sorry.
- Are you okay?

00:20:59.466 --> 00:21:02.260
Yeah, it's okay,
because I know he's there.

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.345
So that's enough for now.

00:21:04.554 --> 00:21:07.723
Hey, it's after midnight!
Merry Christmas, everyone!

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:11.560
Oh, right! Merry Christmas!

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:14.313
The knob was broken...

00:21:14.481 --> 00:21:18.150
...so I turned it off from underneath.
I hope that's all right.

00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:32.498
Rach, these are for you.

00:21:33.417 --> 00:21:35.543
Wiper blades.

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:37.503
I don't even have a car.

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:41.799
Ha, ha. No, but with this new-car smell,
you'll think you do.

00:21:44.678 --> 00:21:47.305
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

00:21:50.809 --> 00:21:52.518
Toilet-seat covers.

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:57.690
Is that what you were doing
while I was getting gas?

00:21:57.858 --> 00:21:59.025
Uh-huh.
Mm-hm.

00:21:59.192 --> 00:22:01.193
You guys!

00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:02.611
And for Ross...

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:05.197
...Mr. Sweet Tooth.

00:22:08.243 --> 00:22:10.244
You got me a cola drink?

00:22:10.454 --> 00:22:13.205
And a lemon-lime!

00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:20.129
Well, this is too much. I feel like
I should get you another sweater.

00:22:22.299 --> 00:22:24.884
And last but not least...

00:22:26.928 --> 00:22:29.597
They're ribbed for your pleasure.
