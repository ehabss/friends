WEBVTT

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:05.713
- She totally winked at me!
- She did not wink at you.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.882
You always think somebody's
winking at you.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.390
Huh.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.448
I say "Tupelo Honey"
by Van Morrison.

00:01:14.616 --> 00:01:15.991
No way!

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.994
The most romantic song ever
was "The Way We Were. "

00:01:19.162 --> 00:01:24.333
Ah, I think the one that Elton John wrote
for, um, that guy on Who's the Boss?

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.295
- What song was that?
- Um.

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:31.673
Hold me close, young Tony Danza

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:37.846
Hi, Monica.
Hi, Mon.

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:39.681
Hey, Mon.

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:42.976
Oh, my God!

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:44.978
- Has she slept at all?
Nope.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:47.064
It's been three nights in a row.

00:01:47.232 --> 00:01:49.066
She finally stopped crying yesterday.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:52.361
But then she found one of Richard's
cigar butts on the terrace...

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:56.949
Oh. Okay, that explains it.
I got a call at 2 in the morning...

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.368
...and all I could hear
was this squeaky sound.

00:01:59.577 --> 00:02:02.204
So I thought,
"Oh, it's a mouse or a possum. "

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:07.209
Then I realized, like, okay...

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:11.421
...where would a mouse or a possum
get the money to make the phone call?

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:16.635
Morning.
- Morning. Hey.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.637
You made pancakes?

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:22.307
Yeah, like there's any way
I could ever do that.

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:26.019
Monica and Rachel had syrup

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:29.439
Uh, uh
Now I can get my man to cheer up

00:02:32.026 --> 00:02:33.443
Good morning, Joey.

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:34.903
Good morning.

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:37.030
Here's a thought.

00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:40.075
Why don't you stay home from work
and just hang out with me?

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:41.326
Oh, I wish.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.705
You have that report to finish,
and I've got to see my lawyer.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:48.041
I can't believe I date
a girl who's getting divorced.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.669
- I'm such a grownup.
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:52.546
I gotta go, I gotta go.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:54.089
Not without a kiss.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.383
Maybe I won't kiss you
so you'll stay.

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.760
Kiss her. Kiss her!

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:03.223
I'll see you later, sweetie.
Bye, Joey.

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.434
Bye-bye, Janice.

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:09.146
So when are you dumping her?

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:10.397
Nope.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:11.648
Not this time.

00:03:11.816 --> 00:03:14.318
Heh. Come on, quit yanking me.

00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:19.448
I'm not yanking you.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.035
- This is Janice.
- Yeah, I know.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.786
She makes me happy.

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:28.081
Okay. All right.

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:31.752
You look me in the eye and tell me,
without blinking...

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.755
...that you're not breaking up
with her. No blinking.

00:03:37.675 --> 00:03:39.384
I'm not breaking up with her!

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:46.558
Ah!

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:47.851
What's that?

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.520
God, look what I found in the drain!

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:52.147
What?

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.525
It's some of Richard's hair!

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:57.236
What do I do with this?

00:03:57.403 --> 00:04:00.405
Getting it away from me
would be job one.

00:04:01.532 --> 00:04:04.660
It's weird, but I don't want
to throw this away.

00:04:04.827 --> 00:04:06.870
This is all I have left of him.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:08.622
Gross...

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.624
...drain hair.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.292
Ew!

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:22.261
Cool! Oh, it looks like a tiny
little person drowning in your cereal.

00:04:24.764 --> 00:04:27.808
- God, what is wrong with me?
- You need to get some sleep.

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:29.309
I need to get some Richard.

00:04:32.855 --> 00:04:35.065
You broke up with him for a reason.

00:04:35.233 --> 00:04:39.236
I know. I know.
I'm just so tired of missing him.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:42.531
Tired of wondering why he
hasn't called. Why hasn't he?

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.825
Maybe because you told him not to?

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.911
What are you, the Memory Woman?

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.915
They're not breaking up!
Chandler and Janice?

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.584
They're not breaking up!
He didn't blink!

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:58.505
I'm not surprised.
Have you seen them together?

00:04:58.673 --> 00:04:59.965
They're really cute.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:03.093
"Cute"? This is Janice!

00:05:03.344 --> 00:05:04.594
You remember Janice?

00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:07.264
Yes, I remember. She's annoying.
But you know what?

00:05:07.432 --> 00:05:10.183
She's his girlfriend now.
I mean, what can we do?

00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:14.021
There you go! That's the spirit
I'm looking for! "What can we do?"

00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:15.856
Huh?

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:18.567
All right, who's first, huh? Ross?

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.403
Chandler's our friend,
and Janice makes him happy.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.364
So I say we be adult about it
and accept her.

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.366
We'll call that Plan B.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:49.931
Honey...

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.434
...I was wondering...
- Mm.

00:05:52.602 --> 00:05:56.438
...do you still have
that, um, Navy uniform?

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.609
No, I had to return it
to the costume place.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:01.860
Oh.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.196
I think I have an old band uniform
from high school.

00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:07.324
You remember not having sex
in high school, right?

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:09.368
Yeah.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.623
Well, honey, what about you?

00:06:14.791 --> 00:06:15.874
- What?
- I mean...

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:22.297
Do you have any fun, you know,
fantasy-type things?

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:24.883
No.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:28.178
Come on. You gotta have one.

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:30.180
Nope.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.849
- Ross, you know what?
- What?

00:06:33.017 --> 00:06:36.728
If you tell me, I might do it.

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.154
Okay.

00:06:46.406 --> 00:06:48.073
- Ahem.
- Um.

00:06:48.241 --> 00:06:52.160
Did you ever see, um,
Return of the Jedi?

00:06:58.167 --> 00:06:59.876
Yeah.

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:03.839
Do you remember the scene...

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.676
...with, um, Jabba the Hutt?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.515
Jabba had as his prisoner...

00:07:13.683 --> 00:07:14.891
...Princess Leia.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.687
Oh.

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:20.856
Princess Leia was wearing...

00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:25.694
...this, um, gold bikini thing.

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:30.031
It was pretty cool.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:36.705
Yeah, Princess Leia and the gold bikini?
Oh, every guy our age loved that.

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.333
- Really?
- Mm-hm. Mm.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.421
It's huge! That's the moment when
she stopped being a princess...

00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:47.424
...and she became, like, you know,
a woman.

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:52.220
Did you ever do the Leia thing?

00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:53.972
Oh, yeah. Mm-hm.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.270
Really? That great, huh?

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:03.773
No, it's just that I got this new
pager, and I have it on "vibrate. "

00:08:08.905 --> 00:08:10.489
See you.

00:08:10.656 --> 00:08:11.740
Hey.

00:08:11.908 --> 00:08:12.991
Hi, you guys!

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.744
Look who I found standing
outside the Szechuan Dragon...

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.622
...staring at a parking meter.

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:23.084
- Ahem. Mon. Hi.
- Hi.

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:26.463
- Why aren't you at work?
- Oh, they sent me home.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.131
Why?

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:31.176
Because I don't work
at the Szechuan Dragon.

00:08:31.385 --> 00:08:33.512
You really need to get some sleep.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.846
I know I do.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:36.473
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:38.517
Guess what?
They published my paper.

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:41.853
- Oh! Really? Let me see, let me see.
- Uh-huh.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:43.230
Rach, look!

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:44.564
No.
- Ooh.

00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:46.316
Hi. Ha, ha.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:49.236
Ha, ha! Oh.

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:52.030
Where is my strong Ross Skywalker
to come rescue me?

00:08:58.454 --> 00:08:59.579
There he is!

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:05.585
- Hey.
- Wheel!

00:09:05.753 --> 00:09:08.088
- Of!
- Fortune!

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:10.590
This guy's so stupid.

00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:12.259
It's Count Rushmore!

00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:18.473
You should really go on this show.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:24.020
I got three tickets to
the Rangers tonight. What do you say?

00:09:24.188 --> 00:09:26.231
I say I am there!

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.108
Cool! Oh.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:29.359
Is Ross going too?

00:09:29.527 --> 00:09:30.902
No. Janice.

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.113
Janice?

00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:37.242
Because I just feel bad for Ross,
you know?

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:42.163
We always go together. We're like
The Three Hockey-teers, you know?

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:47.210
I may be way out on a limb here,
but do you have a problem with Janice?

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:49.004
No!

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:50.880
Yes...

00:09:51.549 --> 00:09:54.175
Oh, God, how do I say this? Uh...

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:57.095
Oh! Ah!

00:09:57.555 --> 00:10:00.140
You know that girl from the
restaurant with the hair?

00:10:00.308 --> 00:10:03.351
Ooh! That girl that I hate?
Ugh! She drives me crazy. Ew.

00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.312
Oh.

00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:09.774
Look, I don't hate Janice.
She's just a lot to take, you know?

00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:14.738
- Well, there you go.
- Oh.

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:16.698
Don't look at me like that.

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:19.326
She drove you nuts before too,
remember?

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:22.621
I'm crazy about her now.
This could be the real thing.

00:10:22.788 --> 00:10:24.873
Capital R, capital T!

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.711
Don't worry, those are
the right letters.

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:33.632
Look, what do you want me to say?

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.217
I want you to say that you like her!

00:10:36.385 --> 00:10:39.346
I can't. It's like this chemical thing,
you know?

00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:42.474
Every time she starts laughing,
I just wanna...

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:48.396
...pull my arm off so
I have something to throw at her.

00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:51.775
Thanks for trying.

00:10:53.486 --> 00:10:57.489
Oh, and by the way,
there is no Count Rushmore!

00:10:57.990 --> 00:11:00.909
Then who's the guy that painted
the faces on the mountain?

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.416
- Ugh.
- How could you tell her?

00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:11.461
I didn't think
it would be that big a deal!

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.505
Oh. She didn't think
it would be a big deal!

00:11:13.673 --> 00:11:15.965
Who are you talking to
when you do that?

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:21.596
Look, that was supposed to be
a private, personal thing between us.

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:26.017
Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay?
We tell each other everything.

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:28.019
Guys do the same thing.

00:11:28.187 --> 00:11:31.106
I mean, what about all that
locker-room stuff?

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:34.150
That's different.
That's like, uh, who dated a stripper?

00:11:34.318 --> 00:11:37.821
Or who did it on the back
of the Staten Island ferry?

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:39.781
- Both of those Joey?
- Yeah.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:44.536
But you don't talk about
your girlfriend...

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:47.914
...and the intimate stuff
you do with her.

00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:50.792
- Not even with your best friend?
- No.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.043
That is so sad.

00:11:53.671 --> 00:11:56.131
You're missing out on so much.

00:11:56.424 --> 00:11:59.050
I mean, the bonding and the sharing...

00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:02.971
...and knowing they're going through
the same thing you are.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:07.642
Oh. So, what, you tell each
other everything?

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:09.561
Pretty much.

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:16.025
Did you talk about
the Night of Five Times?

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:22.157
Do you tell people about
the Night of Five Times?

00:12:22.324 --> 00:12:24.659
Uh, honey, that was with Carol.

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:28.079
I know, but it's still worth
mentioning, I think.

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:33.209
Relax every muscle in your body.

00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:39.174
Listen to the plinky-plunky music.

00:12:40.009 --> 00:12:42.844
Okay, now close your eyes...

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:46.014
...and think of a happy place.

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.057
Tell me your happy place.

00:12:48.225 --> 00:12:50.685
Richard's living room, drinking wine.

00:12:50.853 --> 00:12:56.065
No, no, no. Not a Richard thing.
Just put down the glass and get out.

00:12:56.692 --> 00:12:59.194
I'm sorry, but that's my happy place.

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:04.199
Okay, fine. Use my happy place.
Just don't move anything in there.

00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:06.618
I'll try not to.

00:13:06.786 --> 00:13:10.872
Okay. All right, so,
you're in a meadow...

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.917
...millions of stars in the sky...

00:13:14.084 --> 00:13:16.127
You think breaking up was a mistake?

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.713
There are no questions
in the happy place.

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:26.387
Just the warm breeze and the
moonlight flowing through the trees.

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:28.890
I'll bet he's over me.
I'll bet he's fine.

00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:32.769
Betting and wagering of any kind
are not permitted in the happy place.

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.229
Okay?

00:13:34.396 --> 00:13:37.899
There's just, you know,
the lovely waterfalls...

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:40.610
...and the trickling fountains...

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:45.740
...and the calming sounds
of the babbling brook.

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:47.742
- Okay, this isn't working.
- Oh.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:49.452
I'm still awake,
and now I have to pee.

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.079
Oh.

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:53.122
So I hear...

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.707
...you hate me!

00:13:55.918 --> 00:14:00.421
I, uh, never said hate.
I was very careful about that.

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:05.844
A little birdie told me you wanting to
rip your arm off and throw it at me.

00:14:07.304 --> 00:14:11.558
And you got "hate" from that?
You're taking a big leap there, I, uh...

00:14:11.725 --> 00:14:13.601
All right, fine, fine, fine!

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:17.605
We have got to do something about
our little situation here.

00:14:17.773 --> 00:14:19.399
So this is my idea.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:23.486
You and me spending
some quality time together.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:26.030
But what does that...?

00:14:26.198 --> 00:14:27.615
For Chandler!

00:14:29.159 --> 00:14:30.577
Okay. I'm in.

00:14:30.744 --> 00:14:36.749
Okay! This is what we'll call it:
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:39.002
Does it have to be a day?

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:43.631
Yes, because that's how long
it takes to love me.

00:14:44.174 --> 00:14:48.303
Yeah, I know. Ha.
I sleep in the next room.

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.559
I went down to the post office...

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:57.645
...and it turns out it was
those videos that I ordered...

00:14:57.813 --> 00:15:00.815
...for Richard about the Civil War.

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:03.109
He loved the Civil War.

00:15:04.737 --> 00:15:07.739
Do you want us to take you home?

00:15:07.990 --> 00:15:09.073
Uh-huh.

00:15:11.368 --> 00:15:13.995
Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away.

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:25.173
Women tell each other everything.
Did you know that?

00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:27.508
Ha, ha. Yeah.

00:15:27.885 --> 00:15:30.511
No, Chandler, everything.

00:15:31.513 --> 00:15:34.265
Like stuff you like. Stuff she likes.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:37.852
Technique. Stamina. Girth.

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:40.730
Girth?

00:15:41.565 --> 00:15:43.191
Why? Why? Why?

00:15:43.359 --> 00:15:45.401
Why would they do this?

00:15:46.487 --> 00:15:49.906
Rachel says sharing's great
and supposedly...

00:15:50.074 --> 00:15:52.575
...we ought to be doing it.

00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:55.954
Uh, do you want to?

00:15:57.581 --> 00:16:00.041
- We're not gonna talk about girth?
- No.

00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:02.418
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

00:16:02.586 --> 00:16:04.712
All right, you go first.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.632
- Okay. Okay, I'll go first.
- Okay.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:09.884
So, uh, the other night...

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:13.638
...Rachel and I are in bed
talking about fantasies...

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:17.809
...and I happened to describe
a particular...

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:19.894
...Star Wars thing...

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.271
- Princess Leia and the gold bikini.
- Yes.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.524
- I know!
- Yes.

00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:27.694
Whoa. Wow.

00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:29.404
- Well, that was easy. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

00:16:29.571 --> 00:16:30.655
Okay, you go.

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:31.906
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:35.451
Okay, you know when you're
in bed with a woman...

00:16:35.619 --> 00:16:36.703
Uh.

00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:40.248
...and, uh, ahem, you know,
you're fooling around...

00:16:40.416 --> 00:16:43.209
...and you get all these
mental images in your brain?

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:46.671
Like Elle MacPherson
or the girl at the Xerox place?

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:49.549
- With the bellybutton ring? Oh.
- Oh! I know.

00:16:49.717 --> 00:16:52.301
And then all of a sudden,
your mom pops into your head.

00:16:54.054 --> 00:16:57.724
And you're, like,
"Mom, get out of here!"

00:16:57.975 --> 00:17:00.601
But after that,
you can't think of anything else.

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:06.065
And you can't stop what you're doing.
So it's kind of like you're...

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:08.860
...you know, you know...

00:17:09.028 --> 00:17:11.029
You don't know!

00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:14.449
Your mom?

00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:18.202
You're telling me about your mom?
What's the matter with you?

00:17:19.079 --> 00:17:22.123
- You said...
- I said "share," not "scare"!

00:17:22.291 --> 00:17:24.375
Go sit over there!

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.216
- We're back!
Hey.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.178
What are you guys doing together?

00:17:35.345 --> 00:17:38.306
Joey and Janice's Day of Fun!

00:17:41.101 --> 00:17:42.518
- Really?
Yeah, yeah.

00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:45.021
We went to a Mets game.
We got Chinese food.

00:17:45.189 --> 00:17:48.232
And, uh, you know,
I love this woman. Ha-ha-ha.

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:51.277
You have got competition, buddy.

00:17:52.696 --> 00:17:56.199
Well, I just came by
to give you a kiss.

00:17:56.366 --> 00:17:57.617
Mwah.

00:17:57.826 --> 00:18:02.997
I have to go pick up the baby.
So I'll see you later, sweetheart.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:04.373
You too, Chandler.

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:18.429
- You still can't stand her, can you?
- I'm sorry, man. I tried! I really did!

00:18:20.557 --> 00:18:22.600
I appreciate you giving it a shot.

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.103
But you know, the good thing...

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.731
...is that we spent the whole day
together and I survived.

00:18:28.899 --> 00:18:32.151
And what's even more amazing,
so did she. Ha, ha.

00:18:32.319 --> 00:18:34.278
It was Bat Day at Shea Stadium.

00:18:36.448 --> 00:18:37.657
I guess that's something.

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:39.659
Oh, man, that's huge!

00:18:39.827 --> 00:18:43.246
Now I know I can stand to be
around her. Which means...

00:18:43.413 --> 00:18:45.123
...I get to hang out with you.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.167
Which is kind of
the whole point anyway. Ha, ha.

00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:50.878
Okay.

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:57.552
Oh, hey! We, uh, stopped by
the coffee shop and, uh, ran into Ross.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:04.350
Oh, God.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.103
If it makes you feel any better,
I do it too.

00:19:08.188 --> 00:19:09.814
Oh.

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:11.899
- Really?
- Oh, yeah!

00:19:12.067 --> 00:19:14.569
I always picture your mom
when I'm having sex.

00:19:19.616 --> 00:19:22.076
April 12, 1861.

00:19:26.081 --> 00:19:28.875
The United States garrison
at Fort Sumter was fired upon.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:32.253
It is now under bombardment by...

00:19:43.891 --> 00:19:45.391
Dad, what are you doing here?

00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:49.687
It's your mother's bridge night, so I
came into the city for a Moni-cuddle.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:51.689
Oh.

00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:56.360
Since when did you start
smoking cigars?

00:19:57.321 --> 00:20:01.282
I don't.
I just like the smell of them.

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:04.827
So, uh,
what are you really doing here?

00:20:04.995 --> 00:20:07.205
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

00:20:08.832 --> 00:20:10.625
Why wouldn't I be okay?

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:12.210
I saw Richard.

00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:15.171
Oh?

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:17.215
So how you doing?

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:18.799
I'm fine.

00:20:18.967 --> 00:20:22.094
I'm just a little tired,
but I'm okay.

00:20:22.262 --> 00:20:25.097
- Ahem. How's Richard doing?
- You don't want to know.

00:20:25.265 --> 00:20:28.017
No, I really, really do.

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:30.811
Well, he's doing terrible!

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:34.565
Really?

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:37.485
Worse than when he broke up
with Barbara.

00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:43.199
- You're not just saying that, are you?
- No, the man is a mess!

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:46.661
- Was he crying?
- No.

00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:50.539
Do you think he was waiting till
after you left, so he could cry?

00:20:50.707 --> 00:20:52.416
Maybe.

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:55.544
I think so.

00:20:55.712 --> 00:20:58.923
Honey, relationships are hard.
Like with your mom and me.

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:02.927
You know, after we graduated from
college, we broke up for a while.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:05.638
It seems her father,
your grandfather...

00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:08.432
...wanted her to travel around Europe
like he did.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.352
Of course, he got to do it
on Uncle Sam's nickel...

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.773
...because he was also strafing
German troop trains at the time.

00:21:15.941 --> 00:21:17.024
However...

00:21:58.984 --> 00:22:00.609
Okay, here we go.

00:22:00.777 --> 00:22:03.946
I am Jabba's prisoner.
And you...

00:22:04.614 --> 00:22:07.116
...have a really weird look
on your face.

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:08.743
What? Honey, what is it?

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.411
Did I get the hair wrong?

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:13.039
Or what? Did you just
picture it differently? What?

00:22:13.248 --> 00:22:17.043
No, no. It's, um...
It's not you. It's, um...

00:22:21.882 --> 00:22:26.052
What is it? Come on, sweetie.
You're, like, freaking me out here.

00:22:28.513 --> 00:22:31.307
I hate Chandler.
The bastard ruined my life!
