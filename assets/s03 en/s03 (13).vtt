00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:04.253
Hey.

00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:07.506
Six dollars, please.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.217
Six? I just had it for one night. It's 3.

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:14.054
Eight o'clock is the cutoff.
And, oh, it's 8:02.

00:00:15.724 --> 00:00:18.434
You know, in a weird way,
you have too much power.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:22.646
Look, you're gonna have to help me
out here because I only have 3.

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:24.857
I can help with that.

00:00:25.775 --> 00:00:29.028
Oh, my God. Richard?

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.613
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:00:31.781 --> 00:00:34.366
Wow. Your lip went bald.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:37.578
Thanks.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.457
So you look great.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:42.708
Yeah, right. Ha, ha.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.002
No, you do. You...

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.421
- You just... You...
- What?

00:00:47.672 --> 00:00:49.882
You got panties stuck to your leg.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.930
Ahem, that's because I was just grabbing
some things out of the dryer...

00:00:57.098 --> 00:00:59.224
...and static cling. Ha, ha.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.810
Or maybe it's just because God knew
I'd be running into you...

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:03.687
...and saw an opportunity.

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:05.856
It's good to see you.

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.983
It's good to see you too.

00:02:01.454 --> 00:02:03.705
- See that guy? He's in "Classics" now...
- Who?

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:07.251
...but you know as soon as we leave,
he's going straight to the porn.

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:09.545
He's gonna go up to the counter
with Citizen Kane...

00:02:09.712 --> 00:02:12.172
...Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.
- Ha, ha.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.928
This is nice.

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:19.888
- Ha, ha. Yeah.
- I miss this.

00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:21.431
Me too.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.392
So you wanna get a hamburger
or something?

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.727
Aw, um, I don't know if that's a good idea.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.730
No. Just friends. I won't grope you.
I promise.

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:31.567
Yeah, I think it's too soon.

00:02:31.776 --> 00:02:34.528
No, it's not too soon. I had lunch at 11.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:39.992
Yeah, baby.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:43.453
- What are you doing?
- Making chocolate milk. You want some?

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:45.164
No, thanks. I'm 29.

00:02:46.791 --> 00:02:48.500
Oh, my God. I gotta go to work.

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:51.003
What time do you think
you're gonna get off tonight?

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.921
I don't know, honey.
It could be really late.

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:54.673
Oh, come on. Not again.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:57.718
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.
Listen, I'll make a deal with you, okay?

00:02:57.886 --> 00:02:59.469
- Mm.
- Every night that you're asleep...

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:01.263
...before I get home from work...
- Yeah.

00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:05.350
...I will wake you up in a way
that has proved very popular in the past.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.312
Well, now, if you need to stay late,
I want to be supportive of that.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:09.688
Thank you.

00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:11.607
- Hi.
Hey, Pheebs.

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:13.066
- Hi.
Hey.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.694
Look at you.
Since when do you Rollerblade?

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:18.071
Oh. Since tomorrow.

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:20.282
I met this really cute guy in the park.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.952
And he, like, you know, jogs and blades
and swims, and so we made a deal.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.831
He's gonna teach me how
to do all sorts ofjock stuff.

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.500
- And what are you gonna do for him?
- I'm gonna let him.

00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:32.336
- Okay.
- Cool.

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.630
- Morning.
Hey.

00:03:34.797 --> 00:03:37.049
- Somebody got in late last night.
Ahem.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.384
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:44.139
- When did this happen?
- Oh, um, around 8:02.

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:47.017
And we, uh, talked for a little while...

00:03:47.185 --> 00:03:49.811
...and then, um, we went out
for an innocent burger.

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:52.564
Oh, there's no such thing
as an innocent burger.

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.484
Are you gonna see him again?
- Tomorrow night.

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:57.527
Monica, what are you doing?

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.988
Well, she spent the last six months
getting over him...

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:04.785
...and now she's celebrating that
by going on a date with him.

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:08.247
It's not a date, okay?

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:11.708
I'm just gonna teach him how to make
a lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:14.503
Well, you might want to make a little extra
because, you know...

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.047
...you'll probably be hungry after the sex.
Mm.

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.175
We're not gonna have sex.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.177
Okay? Nothing's changed here.

00:04:22.345 --> 00:04:24.680
He still doesn't want children,
and I still do.

00:04:24.847 --> 00:04:26.765
So that's why we're gonna
just be friends.

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:28.642
Naked friends.

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:35.649
- Hey. Do you have any ice?
- Hey.

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.067
Check the freezer.

00:04:37.235 --> 00:04:39.695
If there's none in there,
we're probably out.

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:42.155
Are you just getting home from work?
It's late.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.658
Yeah, I know.
I had the greatest day, though.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.327
I got to sit in on a meeting
with the reps from Calvin Klein.

00:04:48.037 --> 00:04:51.540
I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie,
she ordered a ton of it.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:52.874
How was your day?

00:04:53.042 --> 00:04:56.253
I discovered I'm able to count all my teeth
using just my tongue.

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:59.381
Hmm.

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:00.841
Um...

00:05:01.426 --> 00:05:04.553
Why do you have a copy of The Shining
in your freezer?

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:08.557
Oh. I was reading it last night
and I got scared, so...

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.228
But, uh, you're safe from it
if it's in the freezer?

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.605
Well, safer.

00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:17.399
I never start reading The Shining...

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.152
...without making sure
we got plenty of room in the freezer.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.403
- You know?
- Ha, ha.

00:05:21.863 --> 00:05:23.739
How often do you read it?

00:05:23.948 --> 00:05:26.533
Haven't you ever read the same book
over and over again?

00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:29.578
Well, um, I guess I read Little Women
more than once.

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.039
But that's a classic.
What's so great about The Shining?

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:35.876
The question should be, Rach,
"What is not so great about The Shining?"

00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:40.922
Okay? And the answer would be, "Nothing. "
All right?

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.883
This is, like, the scariest book ever.

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:45.802
I bet it's way better
than that classic of yours.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.096
- Ha, ha.
- Okay.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:50.432
Uh, well, we'll just see about that, okay?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.313
I will read The Shining,
and you will read Little Women.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.981
- All right, you got it.
- All right?

00:05:58.149 --> 00:05:59.191
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:02.652
- Uh, now, Rach, these little women...
- Yeah.

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:05.238
How little are they?

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:08.408
I mean, are they, like, scary little?

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:17.959
- Um, Chandler, Ross? This is Robert.
Oh, hey.

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:20.253
- Hi.
- You have lipstick right here.

00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:22.130
- Oh.
- Huh. That's okay, it's mine.

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:23.840
We just kissed.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.302
So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.013
Well, I'm from California.

00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:33.683
Right, right. Sometimes you guys
just burst into flame.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:47.823
I'm up. Ahem. I'm up. I've gotten up now.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.908
Anybody, uh, want anything?

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:51.410
- I'll have coffee.
- Yeah, me too.

00:06:51.577 --> 00:06:55.080
Yeah, make that three.
- Okay. Ross, why don't you come with me?

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:59.167
Okay. Ha, ha.

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.504
What is the matter with you?
What's going on?

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:04.673
Robert's coming out.

00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:06.967
What do you mean? What, is he gay?

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:10.387
No, he...

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.434
He's coming out of his shorts.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.688
What?

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.524
The man is showing brain.

00:07:26.571 --> 00:07:29.489
Are you sure? Hold on.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.201
Ahem. I'm sorry, you guys.
That was a coffee and a...

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.203
Coffee. We could write it down.
- Okay.

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:38.331
No, no. That won't be, uh...
Won't be necessary.

00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:47.549
- Well?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:49.759
What do we do? What do we do?

00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:55.140
Well, I suppose we just
try to not look directly at it.

00:07:56.684 --> 00:07:58.560
Like an eclipse.

00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:05.734
When people compliment me
on my cooking tonight, what do I say?

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:09.779
Well, you say, "Thank you very much. "
And then you buy me something pretty.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:12.741
Come on, we're gonna
put our hands in this bowl...

00:08:12.909 --> 00:08:15.952
...and we're gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:19.706
Ooh, this feels very weird.

00:08:19.874 --> 00:08:22.959
Heh. You touch people's eyeballs every day
and this feels weird?

00:08:23.127 --> 00:08:25.253
Yeah, well, sure, I touch them.

00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:28.131
But I spent years
learning not to squish them.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.889
That's my hand.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:37.891
Oh.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:40.519
- Okay.
- Gotta keep squishing.

00:08:40.686 --> 00:08:42.020
The tomatoes are squishing.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:44.481
- Oh, yeah. Oh.
- Oh.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:47.067
Oh, gosh. You got some on your shirt.

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:48.443
- Yeah.
- Hold on a second.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:53.406
Okay, just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.

00:08:53.658 --> 00:08:55.825
It should, um, do...

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:58.745
...the trick.

00:09:07.755 --> 00:09:09.256
What?

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:11.633
Um, you've got some on your pants.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.472
I'll just throw them out.

00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:25.313
These little women.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:27.357
Wow.

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.609
You're liking it, huh?

00:09:29.777 --> 00:09:33.321
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:35.657
I don't see how
he could ever forgive her.

00:09:38.869 --> 00:09:41.871
Um, Jo's a girl.
It's short for Josephine.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.208
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

00:09:47.461 --> 00:09:48.837
Oh.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:53.008
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

00:09:53.175 --> 00:09:55.760
Because that is the one thing missing
from The Shining.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:00.849
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:05.353
No wonder Rachel had to read this
so many times.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:09.024
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:11.109
Hey, how'd the, uh, basketball go?

00:10:11.277 --> 00:10:16.281
Oh, okay. I learned how to shoot a lay-up,
a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:17.949
You mean a 3-pointer?

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:20.619
Oh, I get more because I'm dainty.

00:10:22.079 --> 00:10:24.706
So, um, is there a phone here
I can check my messages?

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:29.044
- Yeah, in the back. Do you want a quarter?
- Oh, no. I always carry one in my sock.

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:44.059
What are you doing?
Get back over on your side of the...

00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:45.852
Hello.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.525
- Hi. I'm Joey. We haven't met.
Hi.

00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:54.611
- Uh, good to meet you. Robert.
- Okay.

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.699
What?

00:11:00.368 --> 00:11:03.703
What? You guys, what is going on?

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.664
Do you not like Robert?

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.124
Why are you laughing?

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:10.335
Calm down. No reason to get testy.

00:11:15.966 --> 00:11:18.677
- You guys. Come on.
- We're sorry.

00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:24.641
It just seems that Robert isn't
as concealed in the shorts area...

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.267
...as, uh, one may have hoped.

00:11:27.561 --> 00:11:28.937
How do you mean?

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:31.398
Hey.
- Hey.

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:36.861
Uh, Robert? Could you, uh,
pass me those cookies?

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:38.697
Sure.

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:46.079
So how'd the lasagna go over?

00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:50.667
Really? Good.
So you owe me three pretty things.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:55.130
Yeah. I've been thinking about you too.

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:59.467
Well, no. It's hard, this platonomy thing.

00:11:59.927 --> 00:12:01.970
What...? It's a word.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:09.561
Yeah. I do think it's better this way.
Yeah, we're being smart.

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.771
Yes, I'm sure.

00:12:13.941 --> 00:12:15.942
You really sure?

00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:18.486
I'll call you back.

00:12:29.165 --> 00:12:31.916
So we can be friends
who sleep together.

00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:35.462
Absolutely.
This'll just be something we do.

00:12:35.629 --> 00:12:37.964
Like racquetball.

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:41.593
Yeah. Sounds smart and healthy to me.

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:46.347
So, um, just out of, uh, curiosity...

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:50.810
...um, do you currently have
any other racquetball buddies?

00:12:51.812 --> 00:12:52.937
Just your dad.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.276
Although that's actually racquetball.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:02.113
You know, I do have a blind date...

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:05.366
...with my sister's neighbor
next Tuesday.

00:13:08.078 --> 00:13:10.038
Do you want me to cancel it?

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:11.706
No.

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:15.084
- No.
- Yeah.

00:13:15.252 --> 00:13:19.172
Because if you did,
that means you'd be canceling for me.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:23.051
- And we're just friends.
- Exactly.

00:13:25.596 --> 00:13:26.679
Hey.

00:13:26.847 --> 00:13:28.723
Hey. Oh, don't sit down.

00:13:28.891 --> 00:13:30.600
- Ready to go to the batting cage?
- You bet.

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:32.894
And first, here's a gift. Ha, ha.

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.939
Oh, wow.

00:13:36.106 --> 00:13:39.567
- Hey.
- Stretchy pants?

00:13:39.944 --> 00:13:41.903
Well, those are the greatest things
in the world.

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.614
If I were you, I'd wear them every day,
every day.

00:13:46.408 --> 00:13:48.910
Jeez, thank you. Really, that's so nice.

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:53.456
But, um, to be honest,
I don't think I can wear these.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:56.876
They're so tight.
I'd feel like I'm on display.

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:00.129
I'm sorry.

00:14:00.297 --> 00:14:03.007
That's all right. I'll figure...

00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:07.637
Hey.
- How you doing?

00:14:07.805 --> 00:14:09.639
- How's it going?
- Good.

00:14:09.807 --> 00:14:10.849
- Good.
Hey, Rach?

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:14.727
- How you doing with The Shining?
- Uh, Danny just went into Room 217.

00:14:14.895 --> 00:14:18.606
Ooh. The next part's the best.
When that dead lady in the bathtub...

00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:21.192
No, no, no. Come on.
You're gonna ruin it.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.736
All right, I'll talk in code.

00:14:23.904 --> 00:14:27.282
Remember when the kid sees
those two blanks in the hallway?

00:14:28.158 --> 00:14:29.868
- Yeah, that's very cool.
Yeah.

00:14:30.035 --> 00:14:34.622
Ooh. All blank and no blank
makes blank a blank-blank, right?

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:38.293
Oh, no, no. No, the end.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.587
When Jack almost kills them all
with that blank...

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:43.423
...but then in the last second
they get away. Aw.

00:14:44.508 --> 00:14:46.676
Joey, I can't believe you just did that.

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:49.512
I can't believe she cracked your code.

00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:58.187
All right, okay. Laurie proposes to Jo
and she says no...

00:14:58.355 --> 00:15:02.650
...even though she's still in love with him.
And then he ends up marrying Amy.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.612
Hey.

00:15:05.779 --> 00:15:08.156
Mine was by accident.

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:09.532
All right.

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.202
The boiler explodes and destroys
the hotel and kills the dad.

00:15:15.331 --> 00:15:16.372
Beth dies.

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:27.884
Beth...? Beth dies?

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.093
Mm-hm.

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:33.097
Is that true?
If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:36.768
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.228
- What?
- Joey's asking if you've just ruined...

00:15:39.396 --> 00:15:42.774
...the first book he's ever loved
that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:49.572
No. She doesn't die.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.616
Then why would you say that?

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:59.540
Because I wanted to hurt you.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.962
Oh, there they are. I dropped my keys.

00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:08.341
Got them.

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:14.389
Hi.

00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:17.433
Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:16:17.601 --> 00:16:19.727
You would not believe my day.

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:23.815
I had to work two shifts.
And then to top it off...

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:28.111
...I lost one of my fake boobs
in a grill fire.

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:32.991
What are you smiling at?

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:35.451
Sorry, I was just thinking your day
could still pick up.

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:43.084
Hello.

00:16:43.794 --> 00:16:45.795
I love this friend thing.

00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:54.804
Listen, Robert's gonna be here
any second...

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:57.015
...so could one of you just tell him?

00:16:57.182 --> 00:16:58.683
- Oh.
Please, right now.

00:16:58.851 --> 00:17:02.854
No, every time I see him, it's like,
"Is it on the loose? Is it watching me?"

00:17:04.648 --> 00:17:05.690
We can't tell him.

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:08.901
You can't go up to a guy you barely know
and talk about his...

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:11.320
...stuff.

00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:15.324
He's right. Even if it's
to say something complimentary.

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:20.663
- Hey.
Hey.

00:17:20.831 --> 00:17:21.873
So you ready for the gym?

00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:25.084
They've got this new rock-climbing wall.
We can spot each other.

00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:29.505
Yeah, I can spot you from here.

00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:34.135
What?

00:17:35.012 --> 00:17:37.555
Okay. Listen, ahem, Robert...

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.684
- Hey, don't we have to?
- Yeah, we got... Yeah. Mm-hm.

00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:46.314
Um...

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:49.984
I think you're really, really great.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:53.488
Oh, God. Here we go again.

00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:58.201
Why does this keep happening to me?
Is it something I'm putting out there?

00:18:00.412 --> 00:18:04.082
Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:10.880
I don't know what to say.

00:18:11.048 --> 00:18:15.802
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.
Put the mouse back in the house.

00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:38.199
Ow.

00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:43.538
Really? Well, it's just like
everyone else's apartment.

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:45.540
It's got, uh, rooms and walls and ceilings.

00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:48.251
I just wanted to see
where you live. Now give me the tour.

00:18:48.418 --> 00:18:50.503
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:52.880
Uh, this is the living room.
That's nice.

00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:54.298
All right.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.135
- And this is the kitchen.
That's real pretty.

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:59.178
Wait a minute.
Don't I get to see the bedroom?

00:18:59.346 --> 00:19:03.391
The bedroom.
Well, it's pretty much your typical...

00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:07.061
...bedroom.
- Oh, ha, ha.

00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:09.480
- We're still on this side of the door. Ha, ha.
- Mm-hm.

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:11.065
Yeah, but I didn't get to see it.

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:15.778
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.
Thanks for a lovely evening.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.506
So, um, who is she?

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:39.427
Oh, ha, ha. That was the blind date
I told you about.

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:42.680
- She called and switched it from Tuesday.
- Aw.

00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:45.641
Did you like her?

00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:50.771
And I'm just asking as a friend
because I am totally fine with this.

00:19:53.275 --> 00:19:55.109
Well, you seem fine.

00:19:55.819 --> 00:19:59.071
Okay, you know what?
I'm not fine. I'm not.

00:19:59.239 --> 00:20:02.992
I mean, how could I be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.578
She wants to see your bedroom.

00:20:12.961 --> 00:20:14.587
You know what?

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:19.133
What if we're friends...

00:20:19.801 --> 00:20:21.719
...who don't see other people?

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:25.640
You mean like exclusive friends?

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:28.059
Why not?

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:32.146
I mean, this has been
the most amazing week.

00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:35.566
Would it be so terrible?

00:20:36.401 --> 00:20:40.488
Even if we were friends
who lived together?

00:20:42.824 --> 00:20:47.161
Or maybe someday, friends who stood
up in front of their other friends...

00:20:47.329 --> 00:20:50.748
...and vowed to be friends forever.

00:20:53.919 --> 00:20:55.378
Wow.

00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:59.507
You know, we're back where we were.

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:06.305
Honey, I would love to do all that,
but nothing's changed.

00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:10.226
That's not true.
You don't have a mustache.

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.730
Okay. Okay, one thing's changed.

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:18.859
But we still want different things,
and we know how this is gonna end.

00:21:20.028 --> 00:21:21.612
You know what?

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.865
I gotta walk out of here right now.

00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:30.204
Because getting over you is
the hardest thing that I have ever had to do.

00:21:31.164 --> 00:21:34.041
Um, I don't think I could do it again.

00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:37.003
I know I couldn't.

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:40.047
Yeah.

00:21:42.759 --> 00:21:44.051
So...

00:21:52.436 --> 00:21:55.354
How about one last game of racquetball?
Hmm?

00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:03.404
- Watch the thorns.
- Ow.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:11.871
What?

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.249
Beth is really, really sick.

00:22:15.584 --> 00:22:16.751
Oh.

00:22:20.756 --> 00:22:24.800
Jo's there, but I don't think
there's anything she can do.

00:22:28.263 --> 00:22:29.680
- Joey?
- Yeah?

00:22:29.931 --> 00:22:32.350
You wanna put the book in the freezer?

00:22:33.268 --> 00:22:35.353
Okay.
