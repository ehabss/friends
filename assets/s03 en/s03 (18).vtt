WEBVTT

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.049
What's so funny?

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:13.345
Oh, nothing. It's an acting exercise.
I'm practicing my fake laugh.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.264
Oh.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.394
What? What's so funny?

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.064
Oh, no, no.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.608
No, no. There's none of that in here.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.112
Oh, come on.
At least let me finish this last one.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.073
Okay, but only if you give me a drag.

00:00:34.534 --> 00:00:35.784
Okay.

00:00:41.666 --> 00:00:45.127
Oh, dark mother, once again
I suckle at your smoky teat.

00:00:48.256 --> 00:00:50.382
Why don't you hold on to that one.

00:00:59.976 --> 00:01:02.936
That's, like, the least fun game ever.

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:06.023
I'm sick of your smoking,
so I brought something...

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:08.525
...that is going to help you quit.

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:10.152
Oh.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:16.992
That patch is no good.

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.915
It's a hypnosis tape.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:26.877
A woman at work used it for two weeks
and hasn't smoked since.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.462
Ha!

00:01:30.006 --> 00:01:31.423
What's your problem?

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:35.511
Nothing. It's just that
hypnosis is beyond crap.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:39.515
I watched you get hypnotized
in Atlantic City.

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:42.184
That guy did not hypnotize me, okay?

00:01:42.352 --> 00:01:46.355
You always pull your pants down
and play "Wipe Out" on your butt.

00:01:48.483 --> 00:01:49.608
Forget hypnosis.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.570
The way to quit smoking is
to dance naked in a field of heather...

00:01:53.738 --> 00:01:56.907
...and then bathe in the sweat
of six healthy young men.

00:01:58.034 --> 00:02:01.245
Or what my father calls
"Thursday night. "

00:02:50.336 --> 00:02:53.505
- Here you go.
- I didn't want cinnamon on this.

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:55.132
Sorry.

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.142
- Hi. Hi.
- Oh, my God! Frank!

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.853
Ha, ha. Hi. How are you?

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.771
What are you doing here?

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.649
I would've called,
but I lost your number.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:16.778
And then, uh, my mom locked me out
of the house, so I couldn't find it.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:21.950
And, uh, then I tried to find a pay phone,
and the receiver was cut off.

00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:24.703
What happened?

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.831
Uh, oh. Vandalism.

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:31.793
But also, what happened
between you and your mom?

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:36.506
We got in a fight. She said that
I was too immature to get married.

00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:39.051
- You're getting married?
- Oh, yeah.

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.844
Aah!

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:44.640
My little brother's getting married! Ha, ha.

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:49.061
I knew you'd be so cool about this.
Uh, hey, do you wanna meet her?

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.479
Do I?

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.147
Do you?

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:54.191
Yeah, I do.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.778
Cool, all right.
She's just parking the truck.

00:03:57.946 --> 00:04:01.657
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go get
my, uh, fiancée, man!

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.789
I'd have bet good money that he'd be
the first one of us to get married.

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:10.791
Isn't it fantastic?

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.253
Yeah, but don't you think he's
a little young to get married?

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.172
- What? He's 18.
- It'll be illegal for him to drink...

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.132
...at his own bachelor party.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.177
Yeah, or to get a hooker.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.222
Always illegal, Joe.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.349
Hey! Hey!

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.310
This is, uh, my fiancée...

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.479
...Mrs. Knight.
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:37.317
- That's my sister.
- You know, it's funny.

00:04:37.485 --> 00:04:41.697
Frank told me so much about you,
but you're not how I pictured you at all.

00:04:42.323 --> 00:04:44.700
Yeah, I'm a big surprise.

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.995
- Here you go. Here, grab a seat.
- Oh.

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:50.706
So how did you guys meet?

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:53.583
Well, um, I was in Mrs. Knight's...

00:04:53.835 --> 00:04:57.754
I mean, Alice. Sorry.
I always do that. Ha, ha.

00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:01.758
I was in her Home Ec class.

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:03.427
He was my best student.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.595
She was my best teacher.

00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:07.222
Aww.

00:05:15.481 --> 00:05:18.358
If that doesn't keep kids in school,
what will?

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.405
And so now you guys
are gonna be married?

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:24.740
Yeah. Ha, ha.

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:28.910
We talked about just living together,
but, um...

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.122
...we wanna have kids right away.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.376
Oh, my God!

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.462
Great!

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:43.175
Wow, kids. Frank,
are you sure you're ready for that?

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.302
How hard can it be?

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:49.806
You know, I mean, you know, babies.
Who doesn't want babies? Right?

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.435
And besides,
I never had a dad around.

00:05:53.644 --> 00:05:57.105
And now I always will,
because it'll be me.

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.988
Really, we do realize that there's
an age difference between us.

00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.824
Good. Because you were
acting like you didn't.

00:06:07.992 --> 00:06:11.328
But when it comes to love,
what does age matter?

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.546
You are falling fast asleep.

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:24.758
Deeper, deeper, deeper.

00:06:24.926 --> 00:06:27.386
You are now completely asleep.

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:29.888
You don't need to smoke.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.641
Cigarettes don't control you.

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:35.894
You are a strong, confident woman...

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:38.897
...who does not need to smoke.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:42.317
A strong, confident woman.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:49.324
You know what? I realized in the last year
I've only gone out with Richard and Julio.

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:53.120
You gotta help me out. Set me up.
Get me back in the game.

00:06:53.287 --> 00:06:57.374
Shouldn't be a problem. I work in fashion,
and all I meet are eligible straight men.

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:02.712
Can I get you something else?

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.757
Cheesecake and a date,
if you're giving them out.

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:08.218
Heh. Haven't we covered that topic?

00:07:08.386 --> 00:07:11.930
- You just said to her...
- You wanna go out with me...

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:15.475
...because of my wig, the big boobs,
and I serve you food.

00:07:15.643 --> 00:07:18.228
If that were true,
I'd be dating my Aunt Ruth.

00:07:20.064 --> 00:07:22.315
And the two times we went out,
it was plain awkward.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:26.111
You think she should go out with me,
don't you?

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:27.487
Ha, ha.

00:07:28.364 --> 00:07:30.574
Well, I mean...

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:32.868
...are you sure
you wanna go out with her?

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:36.580
That ain't a pretty picture
in the morning, know what I mean?

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:40.792
That wig all in disarray,
and boobs flung over the nightstand.

00:07:42.211 --> 00:07:43.753
Really. Think about it.

00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:46.631
Oh, I will. Ha-ha-ha.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:51.178
No, I know.
I know that this is Frank's life.

00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:52.762
You know?

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:56.391
I don't wanna be judgmental,
but it's sick. It's sick and wrong!

00:07:57.852 --> 00:07:59.769
What, is it the age thing?

00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:01.730
No, I'm fine with the age thing...

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.733
...until it sticks its tongue
down my brother's throat.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.904
Pheebs, he seems to enjoy it.

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:13.241
You think he'll enjoy it
when he's up to his elbows in diapers...

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:15.494
...of all the babies
they have to have right away?

00:08:17.288 --> 00:08:21.291
This is not fair to Frank,
and it's not fair to the babies.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.127
You know what?
It's not good home economics.

00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:28.798
Have you told him how you feel?

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:31.676
Yes. Not out loud.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:36.932
If you don't tell him, soon he'll be
married, then you'll hate yourself.

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:40.769
Yeah, but if I do tell him,
then he's gonna hate myself.

00:08:41.103 --> 00:08:44.272
Look at him and his mom.
I can't.

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.777
But you guys can.
You talk him out of it.

00:08:48.945 --> 00:08:50.862
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.948
Come on, you guys.

00:08:54.659 --> 00:08:57.536
You have nothing to lose.
I have everything to lose.

00:08:57.703 --> 00:09:00.163
Do you want me to lose everything?
Everything?

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:04.709
No.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.504
Okay, I'm gonna go get Frank.

00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:13.468
We're walking down the street,
and I turn to you and say:

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:16.930
"Let's go hang out at
Totally Nude Nudes. " Remember?

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:20.725
And then, heh, you say,
"Let's just hang out at your place. "

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.353
Well, that was a nice move, dumb-ass.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:27.357
I think you should
go out with this guy.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:29.401
No, he doesn't do anything for me.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.905
Last Saturday night, what happened
on Walker, Texas Ranger?

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:38.785
Well, um, Walker was looking
for this big busload of kids. Heh.

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:40.996
All right, I get your point.

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:43.540
- Hey.
Hey.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.710
I forgot the combination to this
about a year ago.

00:09:46.877 --> 00:09:49.004
I just carry it around.

00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.133
- You got any Chap Stick?
- Uh, yeah.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:55.010
Hey, how are those tapes working out?

00:09:55.177 --> 00:09:57.637
Pretty good. Good.
I haven't smoked yet today.

00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:02.267
I feel great and confident.
That is a stunning blouse.

00:10:05.688 --> 00:10:07.188
Thank you.

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.024
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:10:09.191 --> 00:10:14.154
Okay, Mon. Let's give Pete a chance.
He was funny. He seems really nice.

00:10:14.322 --> 00:10:16.239
That check thing was adorable.

00:10:16.407 --> 00:10:18.074
What check thing?

00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:23.455
As a joke, this customer who has a
crush on me, gave me a $20,000 tip.

00:10:23.623 --> 00:10:26.374
His number's on the check.
He did it so I'd call.

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:28.877
Pete Becker. Pete...

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:36.635
Is this him?

00:10:37.386 --> 00:10:38.428
That's Bill Clinton.

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:42.557
Who's he hugging?

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:47.937
Oh, my God. That's Pete.
Why is Bill hugging Pete?

00:10:48.105 --> 00:10:49.898
This guy invented Moss 865.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.525
Every office in the world
uses that program.

00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:55.236
- We use it!
- There you go!

00:10:56.113 --> 00:10:58.823
Oh, my God. Monica's gonna go out
with a millionaire.

00:10:58.991 --> 00:11:01.493
- No, I'm not gonna go out with him.
- Oh, my God.

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:05.580
I can't believe this is a real $20,000 check.
This is so exciting.

00:11:06.123 --> 00:11:07.999
Or incredibly offensive.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:09.626
Yeah, sure. That too.

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:24.099
What?

00:11:25.726 --> 00:11:28.561
All we're saying is,
don't rush into anything.

00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:33.108
Come on, think about it.
You're 18, okay? She's 44.

00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:36.736
When you're 36, she's gonna be 88.

00:11:38.614 --> 00:11:40.240
You don't think I know that?

00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:45.286
Look, the point is...

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:48.456
...there's a lot of women
you haven't had sex with yet.

00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:52.419
Yeah, he's right. He's right.
This is your time, you know?

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:56.506
You're young. You're weird.
Chicks dig that.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:12:01.052
But isn't sex better when it's with
one person that you really care about?

00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:03.638
Yeah, in a poem, maybe.

00:12:04.682 --> 00:12:08.226
No, the man's right.
That's what I had with Rachel.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:09.769
You don't have it anymore?

00:12:09.937 --> 00:12:14.107
No, I, uh... I slept with someone else.

00:12:14.275 --> 00:12:17.444
So wait. So how did that
make things better?

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:20.488
It didn't.

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:25.535
What you used to have with Rachel
is what I got with Alice.

00:12:25.703 --> 00:12:27.412
Now what is that like?

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.788
It's so cool, man.

00:12:28.956 --> 00:12:33.543
It's because being with her is so
much better than not being with her.

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:35.128
Yeah. Yeah.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:38.298
- Why can't I find that?
- I had it and I blew it.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:41.050
- Well, I want it!
- You can have it.

00:12:41.218 --> 00:12:43.762
Maybe I can't.
Maybe there's something wrong with me.

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:48.224
No, it's out there, man.
I've seen it! I got it!

00:12:48.893 --> 00:12:51.519
- Then you hold on to it!
- All right, man!

00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:54.522
All right! Congratulations,
you lucky bastard!

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:56.816
You're Frank's best man?

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:01.946
I couldn't help it.
Their love is so pure.

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:05.158
What about you, huh?

00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:07.118
I'm the ring bearer.

00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:26.387
Hi! Oh, Alice, hi. Thanks.

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:30.183
I'm so glad you could come.
I've got a real, um, Home Ec emergency.

00:13:30.351 --> 00:13:33.520
- Oh, my God. Who died on this?
- Yeah, I know.

00:13:33.687 --> 00:13:35.522
It's a real "mustard-tastrophe. "

00:13:37.066 --> 00:13:39.317
- Can you help me?
- Absolutely.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:42.445
Okay, first, we'll start
with a little club soda and salt.

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:45.740
- Then if that doesn't work...
- You know what? Forget it. It's ruined.

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:49.619
Oh, no, never say that. If you can't
get it out, cut around the stain...

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:52.455
...add a little lace,
you make a stylish throw.

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:57.544
Or instead, maybe you could just
not marry my brother, Frank?

00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:05.468
Can we make it smaller?
Make it fit on the head of a pin?

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:07.929
I love when we make things
fit on the head of a pin.

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:09.305
- Got it, yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:12.684
You have Monica Geller here.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:15.770
Uh, absolutely. Yeah, send her in.

00:14:16.146 --> 00:14:17.564
Hi.

00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:20.275
What the hell is this?

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.361
Hang on for a sec.
I'll talk to you in the morning?

00:14:23.529 --> 00:14:24.571
You got it.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:28.825
- I'm sorry. What?
- What's this supposed to mean?

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:32.245
Well, you know,
I never know how much to tip.

00:14:34.081 --> 00:14:37.375
You double the tax.
Not double the tax of Romania.

00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:41.129
I mean, what's the deal?
Are you trying to buy me?

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.381
Is this the way you get girls
to go out with you?

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:45.800
Uh, I'm still here.

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:52.140
You're taking this wrong.
If I didn't leave you that tip...

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:55.476
...you wouldn't have come,
we wouldn't have this argument...

00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:57.979
...and there wouldn't be this,
uh, heat between us.

00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:59.814
- What?
- Come on.

00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:03.818
You gotta admit that our relationship
is hitting a new level now.

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:06.487
You were the chef,
and I was the customer.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.907
But now we're this couple that fights.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:11.492
Okay, um...

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:12.952
...you're a loon.

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:17.916
Look, forget the check, okay?
I like you.

00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:20.126
I think you're great.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.420
Come on, what do you say?

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:26.341
I don't know.

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:27.842
Why not?

00:15:28.844 --> 00:15:31.304
I don't wanna encourage this behavior.

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:36.351
One meal.
That's all I'm asking for. Please?

00:15:36.977 --> 00:15:38.478
We go out, we eat.

00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:42.273
If you don't have a good time,
I'll give you 10 grand, we're even.

00:15:52.868 --> 00:15:55.078
Hi.
- Aah! No!

00:15:55.245 --> 00:15:58.247
Wait, no. Just put the mail down.
It's me.

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.835
Sorry. Why were you just all in the dark?

00:16:03.003 --> 00:16:08.174
Well, um, your laundry smelled so good
that I thought I'd curl up in it.

00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:10.385
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, sure.

00:16:10.552 --> 00:16:12.178
So how was your day?

00:16:12.346 --> 00:16:16.140
It's just probably the worst one
since I've been alive.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.395
What, um...? What happened?

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:22.772
Um, Alice, uh...

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.191
She, uh, called it off.

00:16:25.359 --> 00:16:26.901
Oh, no.

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.572
Did, um... Did she say why?

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.575
Uh, no, not really.
Just that I was too young.

00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:37.578
I don't see how I could
suddenly be too young...

00:16:37.746 --> 00:16:41.207
...because I'm older than I was
when we first got together.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.211
Yeah, yeah, no, I don't...

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:50.216
I don't know. But you know what?
Maybe it's just all for the best.

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:53.970
Well, yeah, if the best is
like unbelievable pain.

00:16:54.138 --> 00:16:56.264
Oh, sweetie.

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.726
You know, I was just finally happy.

00:16:59.893 --> 00:17:02.603
For the first time in my life...

00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:05.231
...after my dad left me...

00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:10.570
...and then getting arrested
for stealing those birds...

00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:14.532
...and then the whole
punctured-lung thing.

00:17:15.868 --> 00:17:19.328
It's still really hard to take
deep breaths in cold weather...

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:23.458
...but with Alice,
all that stuff kind of went away.

00:17:24.752 --> 00:17:29.130
And now it's gone,
and I don't know why.

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:35.094
Ugh. Well, I can tell you why.
It's because of me.

00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:39.474
But you know what? I only did it
because I love you, okay?

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:46.355
- What?
- Um, I kind of had a little chat with Alice...

00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:49.734
...and I sort of made her see
why you two shouldn't be together.

00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:53.237
And you'll see it too, one day.
You really, really will.

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.948
Wait a minute.
This is because of you?

00:17:56.116 --> 00:17:57.158
Okay...

00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:00.495
Wait, no. My mother didn't want us
to be together...

00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:03.581
...but the worst thing she did
was tie me to the porch.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:05.792
Okay, but...

00:18:05.959 --> 00:18:09.545
I came to you because
I thought you'd understand.

00:18:09.713 --> 00:18:12.006
Oh, no!

00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:14.467
No... Ugh.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:16.803
I would storm out of here...

00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:20.807
...if I had some money
or a place to go.

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:29.023
Oh, my God! The millionaire's here!

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.234
Oh, my God!

00:18:36.031 --> 00:18:38.533
Guys, please.
I'm just gonna have dinner with him.

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:43.496
Okay, just because he buys you dinner
does not mean you owe him anything.

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:46.124
I know.

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:49.961
Okay, then get the lobster.

00:18:53.757 --> 00:18:54.841
Hey.
- Hi.

00:18:55.008 --> 00:18:56.217
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:18:56.385 --> 00:18:57.593
Hello.

00:18:58.428 --> 00:19:01.013
Hey, how much cash you got
in your pocket right now?

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:07.603
And that's why I'm not
inviting you in for a drink. Bye.

00:19:07.771 --> 00:19:09.814
Why not? Hey, come in for drink.

00:19:11.358 --> 00:19:13.401
- Where do you wanna go?
- You like pizza?

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:17.029
- Oh, that sounds great.
- I know a great little place.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:25.246
You're not paying for the pizza.

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:28.958
Come on, it's only fair.
You paid for the flight.

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:30.710
Is that enough lira?

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.212
Uh, I'd throw another 1000 on that.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:36.299
- How much is that?
- That's about 60 cents.

00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:49.937
Every night!

00:19:51.732 --> 00:19:54.025
You don't need to smoke.

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:56.694
Cigarettes don't control you.

00:19:56.862 --> 00:20:00.531
You are a strong, confident woman...

00:20:00.699 --> 00:20:03.492
...who does not need to smoke.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.954
A strong, confident woman...

00:20:07.122 --> 00:20:10.333
...who does not need to smoke.

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:13.127
So can I.

00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:20.760
Hey, Frank.

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:25.806
Look, I know that you think I did
this totally evil thing.

00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:27.433
But I so didn't.

00:20:28.644 --> 00:20:31.646
Someone's here who can explain this
better than I can.

00:20:33.106 --> 00:20:34.690
We can go look.

00:20:37.152 --> 00:20:38.319
Hi, Frank.

00:20:42.032 --> 00:20:45.284
Hi, Mrs. Knight.

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:49.789
Phoebe's right, Frank.

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:54.335
It's hard to hear, but it would've
been wrong to go through with it.

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.254
I was being selfish.

00:20:56.421 --> 00:21:00.299
Even though we want
the same things right now...

00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:03.344
...in the future, we may not.

00:21:04.471 --> 00:21:07.014
- Is that what it is?
- Yes, but not just that.

00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:09.308
Right, not just that.

00:21:12.187 --> 00:21:17.525
Even though we love each other
as much as we do...

00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:19.652
...nonetheless...

00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:23.864
- Nonetheless.
- Nonetheless.

00:21:26.368 --> 00:21:27.702
Um...

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:31.205
You're too young...

00:21:31.707 --> 00:21:35.042
...to really know what you want.

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:37.211
That's right, exactly.

00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:41.674
That's a goodbye kiss.
That's good.

00:21:44.011 --> 00:21:45.386
Bye-bye.

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:50.850
The important thing is,
is that you see what I'm saying.

00:21:51.518 --> 00:21:53.728
This is clearly wrong.

00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.773
I've decided I'm gonna
let this happen.

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:00.860
Okay, can I just get my purse?

00:22:01.028 --> 00:22:03.654
Mmm.
- Okay, all right, good.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.120
Cigarettes don't control you.

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:14.373
You are a strong, confident woman...

00:22:14.541 --> 00:22:17.418
...who does not need to smoke.

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:22.840
Joey's your best friend.

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:27.553
You wanna make him
a cheese sandwich every day.

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:35.061
And you also wanna buy him
hundreds of dollars worth of pants.
