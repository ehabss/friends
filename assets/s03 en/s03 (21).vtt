WEBVTT

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:05.713
So whose idea was it to put
everybody in the diner on skates?

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.924
Some idiot customer put a suggestion
in the suggestion box.

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:11.301
- Oh, my God. They took my idea.
- That was you?

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:12.678
Yeah.

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:14.680
Okay, there you go.

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:17.057
Rachel, I made you a cocoa.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:18.809
Oh, that's so... Aah!

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:20.936
Ow!

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.647
- Oh, my God. Are you guys okay?
- You all right?

00:00:26.484 --> 00:00:27.818
Oh, my.

00:01:20.997 --> 00:01:22.748
Hey.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.292
You know, with that goatee,
you kind of look like Satan.

00:01:27.962 --> 00:01:31.090
Oh, so that's why the priest
threw holy water on me.

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:35.344
Okay, listen, you have to cheer up.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.805
Okay? You should come out
with Ross and me.

00:01:37.972 --> 00:01:41.475
I mean, anything is better than sitting
around here crying all day about Kate.

00:01:41.643 --> 00:01:43.811
Hey, I was crying because...

00:01:43.978 --> 00:01:47.397
Because nobody believed Quincy's theory,
okay?

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:50.067
- Hey. I'm gonna be on TV.
Hey.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:51.610
- No way.
Yeah.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.447
They're putting together this panel to talk
about these fossils they found in Peru.

00:01:55.615 --> 00:01:57.199
The Discovery Channel's gonna film it.

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:01.161
Oh, my God. Heh.
Who's gonna watch that?

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:04.289
- Thanks. You ready to go?
Yeah.

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:06.667
Ahem, I saw a girl with that vest.

00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.210
Thanks.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:14.758
- Most of us think of chocolate bunnies
and baskets as traditional Easter gifts.

00:02:14.926 --> 00:02:17.845
Some people insist on
giving live chicks as presents.

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:21.140
Unfortunately, the sad fact remains...

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.226
...that most of these little guys
won't live to see the Fourth of July.

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:27.646
Because as a result of improper care,
they will be dead.

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:30.065
You guys got any of those baby chicks?

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.609
Because I was watching this,
uh, commercial on TV...

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:35.404
...and, man, those things are cute.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.241
- Hi.
Hi.

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.661
Oh, Pete, you're back.
Hey, check this out.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.621
Wow. Skates. Ha, ha.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:46.206
Whoa.

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:52.462
Wow. You're a lot sturdier than Chandler.
He crumbled like a piece of paper.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.630
So how was your trip?

00:02:53.798 --> 00:02:56.633
- Well...
- Oh, what did you bring me?

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:01.305
Aw, hotel toiletries from Japan. Oh.

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:03.515
These are gonna go
in my permanent collection.

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:06.143
- You want some coffee?
- Sure, that'd be great.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.311
Okay.

00:03:10.398 --> 00:03:12.274
- Regular or decaf?
Ha, ha.

00:03:12.442 --> 00:03:15.194
- Uh, whichever's closest.
All right.

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:17.029
- Okay.
- So ask me what I did today.

00:03:17.197 --> 00:03:18.488
So, what did you do today, Pete?

00:03:18.656 --> 00:03:21.158
I bought a restaurant,
and I would like you to be the chef.

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:22.993
What? Oh.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.334
Can you believe
he just offered me a restaurant?

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:33.545
What a jerk.
You want me to kick his ass?

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:37.341
I mean, this has been my dream
since I got my first Easy-Bake Oven...

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:40.135
...and opened Easy-Monica's Bakery.

00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:50.520
I mean, I would kill for this job.
I mean, I can totally do this job...

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:54.983
...and God knows I've paid my dues. Ugh.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.570
But Pete's just doing this
because he has a crush on me.

00:03:58.738 --> 00:04:02.574
- And you're still not attracted to him at all?
- Mm. No.

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:05.494
I mean, how could I accept a restaurant
from him? I can't.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.872
I couldn't even accept a necklace
from Stu Vincent in the seventh grade.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.043
Yeah, Mon, that was totally different.
He was your health teacher.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.170
- Ow.
- What, honey?

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:18.799
Ow, my side still hurts
from when you crashed into me yesterday.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.717
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry.
- I know. Ow.

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:22.511
Oh, God.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:25.722
- Hey, you guys. Guess what.
Hey.

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:31.270
Got a job on a riverboat?

00:04:33.564 --> 00:04:36.525
You know what? I didn't wear this suit
for a year because you hated it.

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.902
Guess what. You're not my girlfriend
anymore, so...

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.571
- Oh, I see. So this suit is making a point.
Mm.

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:44.908
Now that you're on your own,
you're free to look as stupid as you'd like.

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:47.703
You like it, right?

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.248
Absolutely. I like it even more on you
than I did on Colonel Sanders.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:54.376
Huh. Ross, Ross, I'm kidding.
Come here.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.546
- What were you gonna tell us?
- Was it how you invented the cotton gin?

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:58.797
Okay, goodbye.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.926
So, um, after you put the suggestion
in the box...

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.595
...how long did it take
for the roller-skating thing to happen?

00:05:05.763 --> 00:05:07.472
Um, about three months.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.392
Okay, so I guess that's about,
uh, two weeks...

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.185
...before the topless thing kicks in.

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:16.773
- Hey.
Hey.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:21.486
I got you something. Open it. Open it.

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:24.031
Okay.

00:05:28.578 --> 00:05:30.078
It's a chicken.

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.664
It's cute, huh?

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:35.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You guys,
do you know anything about chicks?

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:37.836
Fowl? No.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.839
Women? No.

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:43.800
Okay, well,
they are a huge responsibility.

00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:46.970
Especially at this age.
They require constant care.

00:05:47.138 --> 00:05:50.057
They need just the right food
and lots and lots of love.

00:05:50.224 --> 00:05:53.518
Oh, well, no problem there.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:05:59.566
Easy, Lenny.

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:07.407
So, I mean, have you thought about it?

00:06:07.575 --> 00:06:08.950
Okay, here's the thing.

00:06:09.118 --> 00:06:11.995
Oh, no. Not "the thing. "
I hate "the thing. "

00:06:12.163 --> 00:06:13.455
What's "the thing"?

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:16.458
I can't do it.

00:06:16.626 --> 00:06:18.460
I'm sorry. I wish I could...

00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:21.463
...but, um, see,
you have these feelings for me.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.007
Wait, wait, wait.
That's what you're worried about?

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.926
If that's the problem,
we've got no problem.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:27.677
- Huh?
- No.

00:06:27.845 --> 00:06:31.681
I was gonna tell you this over dinner,
but I met somebody else, on my trip.

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.058
Oh?

00:06:33.267 --> 00:06:36.144
Her name's Ann. She's a journalist.
Uh, we met on the plane.

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:38.146
She asked me if she could
finish off my peanuts.

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:41.024
I thought she said something else.
We had a big laugh.

00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:46.113
Yeah, I just...
I mean, I got tired of waiting.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:51.827
Oh, that's great. I mean,
I'm sorry, but I'm so happy for you.

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:54.037
- And now I can work for you.
- I guess you can.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:58.625
Oh, my God. Oh, this is incredible. Oh.

00:06:59.127 --> 00:07:02.921
All right. You know what? I'm just gonna
roll right into that office and quit.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.714
- All right.
- Okay.

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:07.300
- Could you give me a little push?
- Yeah, sure.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:10.637
- Good luck.
I'm quitting. Woo-hoo!

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:16.476
I'm okay. I'm all right.

00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:23.567
Wow. That's exciting.
You went to Japan, made up a woman.

00:07:24.193 --> 00:07:25.527
What?

00:07:25.736 --> 00:07:29.531
I'm just saying, this woman,
I mean, she's fictitious, no?

00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:32.701
- Why would you say that?
- You're still into Monica.

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.954
So you told her there's somebody else
so she'd agree to work with you.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.374
Because you figure, if you spend time
together, maybe something might happen.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:42.878
You're good. You're good.

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.673
Yeah. No, I'm fairly intuitive.
And psychic.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.134
It's a substantial gift.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:53.054
Listen, can you promise me
that you won't tell her, though?

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:56.975
Absolutely. Oh, I promise. Tell her what?

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.269
Thanks a lot.

00:07:59.437 --> 00:08:02.230
No, I'm serious. I mean, I'm intuitive,
but my memory sucks.

00:08:04.525 --> 00:08:06.568
Okay, but this is the last time.

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:10.155
With a chick-chick here
And a chick-chick there

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:13.074
Here a chick, there a chick
Everywhere a chick-chick

00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:14.701
Chicken

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.246
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:20.290
How's she doing?

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:21.875
She?

00:08:22.043 --> 00:08:23.919
Well, yeah. Don't you think it's a she?

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:26.254
I don't know.

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:38.892
I can't tell. Whatever it was,
went back in too quickly.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:43.438
Anyway, I gotta change.
I'm meeting some of the cast for drinks.

00:08:43.606 --> 00:08:44.898
Excuse me?

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:46.566
What?

00:08:46.734 --> 00:08:48.860
I stayed home from work
while you were at rehearsal...

00:08:49.028 --> 00:08:51.571
...so somebody could be here
with our chick.

00:08:51.739 --> 00:08:56.034
Hey. Who was up from 2:00 this morning
until 5:00 this morning...

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:58.161
...trying to get her back to sleep?

00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.664
You don't think I get up
when you get up?

00:09:01.832 --> 00:09:03.083
Oh, here it comes.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:06.795
Yes. Here it comes.
I'm stuck here all day.

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:10.131
And then you come in
and spend two seconds with us...

00:09:11.968 --> 00:09:15.387
...and then expect to go off
gallivanting with your friends?

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:17.514
Well, I don't think so, mister.

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:22.310
Hey. I need to relax, okay?
I was working all day.

00:09:22.603 --> 00:09:25.647
And you don't think
taking care of our chick is work?

00:09:28.442 --> 00:09:30.944
That's not what I said.
Okay, I just meant...

00:09:31.112 --> 00:09:33.613
I know what you meant.

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:42.622
Did you notice that ever since
we got this chick...

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:46.126
...we've been fighting
a lot more than we used to?

00:09:48.212 --> 00:09:51.047
I don't know, maybe we weren't ready
to have a chick.

00:09:53.134 --> 00:09:55.302
I'll take her back tomorrow.

00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:57.012
You think we'll get our 3 bucks back?

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.682
- Hey.
Hey.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:01.975
Oh. Hey.

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:05.937
Listen, I have that TV thing in,
like, two hours, and I need your help.

00:10:06.105 --> 00:10:09.691
Okay, what do you think?
This blue suit or this brown one?

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:12.736
Well, the brown one
brings out your eyes.

00:10:12.903 --> 00:10:14.988
But your butt looks great
in the blue one.

00:10:17.241 --> 00:10:18.658
Really?

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:23.163
Ow.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:35.467
Wow. That aspirin dance really works.

00:10:37.428 --> 00:10:39.429
Ow.
- Oh, my God. Is that still?

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:40.889
I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.557
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:44.017
- Rach.
- Look, I'm fine.

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.436
Watch. Look at that. Uh-oh.

00:10:47.647 --> 00:10:50.523
Okay, okay. Look, you've got
to go to a doctor, okay?

00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:53.818
No, I have to get ready and go
to a dinner at my boss's house.

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:56.154
Very big deal. There's people there
that I have to meet.

00:10:56.322 --> 00:10:59.449
Yeah, and I'm sure you're gonna make
a great impression. "Hi, I'm Rachel.

00:10:59.617 --> 00:11:01.493
It's nice to meet you. "

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.537
Come on, you probably
have a broken rib.

00:11:04.705 --> 00:11:08.166
Well, I will go to the hospital tomorrow.
It'll still be broken then.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:10.543
But you know, I could use a hand
getting ready.

00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:12.796
- Rachel.
- Look, either help me or go.

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:14.714
Fine. I'll go.

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.468
Okay, but before you go,
could you help me first?

00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:24.432
Sure. I'll help you.

00:11:24.809 --> 00:11:26.267
Oh, good. Good.

00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:28.770
Do you guys know how
to get a chick out of a VCR?

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:42.617
You know what?
I cannot do this with my left hand.

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:45.328
Would you please help me
with this too?

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.422
- Okay. Let's use this brush.
- Okay.

00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:57.632
- This stuff? All right.
- Yeah. Careful.

00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:01.219
Light. Okay, you know,
just sweep it across the lid.

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.596
- Okay, just sweep it.
- Okey-dokey.

00:12:03.764 --> 00:12:05.348
- Oh. Hey.
- Sorry.

00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:07.308
- Ha, ha. That's poking me in the eye.
- Ha, ha.

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:09.018
I'm sorry. Close, close, close.

00:12:09.186 --> 00:12:10.562
- Okay, just sweep it.
- I'm sweeping.

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:13.440
- Right.
- Sweep, sweep...

00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:15.525
Okay, now make it even,
because we don't...

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:17.444
- What?
- We don't want it...

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:19.821
I don't want it to be too much.
I want it to be subtle.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.323
You know,
you don't wear enough of this.

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:30.498
Since when...? Since when do you think
I don't wear enough of this?

00:12:30.666 --> 00:12:34.919
Well, I... Close your eye. I just think
you're gonna like this better because...

00:12:35.129 --> 00:12:36.838
- Close, close.
- Blow it.

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.256
Sorry.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:41.843
Because, um, I think this will make you
a little more sophisticated.

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:43.720
Sophisticated like a hooker?

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:48.558
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.393
- Guess what I'm doing tonight.
- What?

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.562
I'm checking out the restaurant
with Pete.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:56.232
- Oh. Monica, I am so excited for you.
- I know.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.942
Ooh, I have to tell you something.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.820
- What?
- Well, I can't tell you.

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.034
Okay, but wouldn't it be easier to tell
me something that you could tell me?

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:08.328
Well, sure, in a perfect world.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:13.917
But no. I promised I wouldn't tell,
and I swore to, like, all my gods.

00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:16.920
Okay.

00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:18.922
Does it have to do
with Ross and Rachel?

00:13:19.089 --> 00:13:20.256
No.

00:13:20.424 --> 00:13:22.509
- Does it have to do with Joey?
- No.

00:13:22.676 --> 00:13:26.262
Does it have to do with Chandler
and that sock that he keeps by his bed?

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.433
No, but let's come back to that later.

00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:38.191
There you go.
Good enough for your party? Huh?

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.074
Sure.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:50.578
Sure. I'll just sit next to
the transsexual from Purchasing.

00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:53.957
Come on.

00:13:54.124 --> 00:13:58.586
Okay, come on. All right, I gotta go.
So good luck at the party, okay?

00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:01.548
Oh, wait, Ross. Could you just stay
and help me get dressed?

00:14:04.093 --> 00:14:05.468
Sure. Okay.

00:14:05.636 --> 00:14:09.764
Okay. Okay, great.
Um, okay, just turn around.

00:14:10.015 --> 00:14:12.767
- What?
- I don't want you to see me naked.

00:14:12.935 --> 00:14:17.438
Rachel, I've seen you naked a million times.
I ate hot fudge off you naked.

00:14:17.606 --> 00:14:20.817
I sucked that mini-marshmallow
out of your bellybutton.

00:14:22.236 --> 00:14:24.946
Yeah, but that was different, you know?
We were going out then.

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:26.739
Now it's weird.

00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:30.535
Rach, you know,
I can see you naked anytime I want.

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:32.620
- What?
- Ha, ha.

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:37.834
All I have to do is close my eyes.
See? Woo-hoo.

00:14:40.462 --> 00:14:43.548
- Ross, stop that.
- I'm sorry.

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:46.634
Come on. I don't want you
thinking of me like that anymore.

00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:48.761
Uh, sorry. Nothing you can do about it.

00:14:48.929 --> 00:14:51.472
It's one of my, uh, rights
as the ex-boyfriend.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.892
Huh? Oh. Oh, yeah.

00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:57.979
- Stop it. Cut it out. Cut it out.
- Okay, okay.

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:00.315
I'm sorry. It will never happen... Uh-oh.

00:15:00.482 --> 00:15:02.025
Wait a minute. Wait, wait...

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:05.403
Now there are a hundred of you,
and I'm the king.

00:15:07.114 --> 00:15:08.448
- Ross...
- Oh, come on.

00:15:08.657 --> 00:15:10.992
Would you grow up? It's no big deal.

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:14.996
All right. Fine.

00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:17.373
- Yowza.
- Okay.

00:15:19.084 --> 00:15:21.419
See what you did?
I'm gonna be doing it by myself now.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:23.379
- Okay, that's it. Ow!
- Oh, come on.

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:26.174
Oh, my God. All right, look, look, okay.

00:15:26.342 --> 00:15:30.345
Rach. Easy. Easy.
You have to go to the hospital, okay?

00:15:30.512 --> 00:15:32.472
- Okay, I do. I really do.
- Okay.

00:15:32.681 --> 00:15:35.141
Okay, I'm gonna get your coat,
then I'll put you in a cab.

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:37.185
Oh, wait, wait,
you're not gonna come with me?

00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:42.941
Of course I am.

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:45.109
Uh, I just have to make a call.

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:46.402
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.446
Thank you.

00:15:51.408 --> 00:15:53.368
Ow!

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:54.661
What's wrong?

00:15:54.828 --> 00:15:58.498
I'm sorry. I just can't go to the hospital
looking like this.

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:01.876
- Does it involve travel?
- No.

00:16:02.169 --> 00:16:04.379
Does it involve clogs?

00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:07.090
Wait, wait. Clogs or claws?

00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:09.050
- Clogs.
- No.

00:16:09.218 --> 00:16:10.718
- Claws?
- No.

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:17.392
Okay, so it doesn't involve Ross or Rachel
or Chandler or Joey.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:19.936
- What about Pete?
- No.

00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:21.854
What is it?

00:16:22.648 --> 00:16:25.316
- What about Pete?
- I don't know.

00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:28.319
Okay, I feel like I'm talking to Lassie.

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:33.950
- Phoebe, would you just tell me?
- I can't.

00:16:34.118 --> 00:16:37.120
- Okay, you know, I gotta go.
- But you're so close. No.

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:39.247
Something to do
with Pete's company?

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:40.999
Ugh. Just go. You're never gonna get it.

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:52.260
I know.

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:55.847
See, yes. That's Yasmine Bleeth.

00:16:56.098 --> 00:16:58.850
She's a completely different
kind of chick.

00:17:02.896 --> 00:17:04.814
I love you both.

00:17:06.025 --> 00:17:08.484
But in very different ways.

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:11.195
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:17:11.655 --> 00:17:13.406
Ooh. Ah.

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:16.325
What are you doing?
I though you were gonna take her back.

00:17:16.493 --> 00:17:18.578
I did. But the store
wouldn't take her back.

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:22.123
So then I took her to the shelter.
And you know what I found out?

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:31.507
If they can't find a home for her,
they kill her.

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:34.135
And I'm not gonna let that happen
to little Yasmine.

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:37.805
Okay, good, good, good.

00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:40.391
Because I was kind of having
second thoughts too.

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:44.479
Okay. And it's not just chicks, you know?
It's all kinds of other animals.

00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:47.315
That's horrible.
Well, you did the right thing, man.

00:17:47.483 --> 00:17:49.442
Thanks. I'm glad you see it that way.

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:03.581
Oh, funny story.

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:08.169
I don't believe this.

00:18:08.337 --> 00:18:11.923
Wow, look at this refrigerator.
It's gigantic.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:15.885
I mean, I could live in this thing.
I'd be cold, but I'm always cold.

00:18:17.638 --> 00:18:21.099
Oh, my God. Look at these spider burners.
I love spider burners.

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.517
So you like it?

00:18:22.684 --> 00:18:26.938
Oh, it is so perfect. Thank you so much.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.315
- You're welcome.
- Oh.

00:18:35.155 --> 00:18:36.572
Did you just smell my hair?

00:18:37.825 --> 00:18:40.201
No. No way. What? No.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:42.954
- Oh, God.
- What?

00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:46.249
You still have feelings for me,
don't you?

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:50.336
No. I'm just excited about the restaurant,
that's all.

00:18:50.838 --> 00:18:52.755
- Pete?
- Okay, I love you. Is that so bad?

00:18:54.925 --> 00:18:57.969
No, it's not bad. It's not bad at all.

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:59.220
It's really nice.

00:18:59.763 --> 00:19:03.516
Look, the only one who stands to get hurt
is me, and I'm okay with that.

00:19:04.017 --> 00:19:06.352
Yeah, you may be okay
with getting hurt...

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.730
...but I am not okay with being
the one who hurts you.

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:14.777
- That's why I can't take this job.
- What?

00:19:16.071 --> 00:19:18.698
Well, we probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.

00:19:19.825 --> 00:19:21.075
I'm sorry.

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:23.452
Okay. Yeah.

00:19:23.954 --> 00:19:27.790
I mean, if that's really what you want,
okay.

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:32.587
Okay. Bye.

00:19:38.051 --> 00:19:39.468
I'm sorry things didn't work out...

00:19:39.636 --> 00:19:43.931
Shut up for a second
and let me just see something.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:50.938
Oh, wow.

00:19:57.779 --> 00:19:59.280
Okay, you'd tell me the truth, right?

00:19:59.448 --> 00:20:03.201
- Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
- Okay.

00:20:04.077 --> 00:20:09.248
Hey, now, you stay out here
and you think about what you did.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:13.628
- That's a duck.
- That's a bad duck.

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:20.218
- How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
- Oh, it was... No, no.

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:21.469
What thing? What thing?

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:24.263
Nothing. There was this thing
at the museum. Come on.

00:20:25.265 --> 00:20:26.557
Easy.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:29.518
Okay, now, when you come back...

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:32.480
...I hope you remember
that that chick is not a toy.

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.277
What thing? What is this thing?

00:20:38.445 --> 00:20:43.157
Aw, I was kind of supposed to be on TV
tonight for the Discovery Channel.

00:20:43.742 --> 00:20:45.660
Oh, my God.

00:20:45.827 --> 00:20:47.578
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:50.539
Ah, I knew that if I told you,
you'd make me go...

00:20:50.707 --> 00:20:54.835
...and I knew you needed someone
to be with you tonight. Come on.

00:20:55.003 --> 00:20:57.213
- Come on.
- I cannot believe you.

00:20:57.381 --> 00:21:00.967
- What?
- That is the sweetest thing.

00:21:11.603 --> 00:21:13.062
You should get some sleep.

00:21:13.689 --> 00:21:15.147
Okay.

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:17.775
- So I'll, um...
- I'm sorry I spoiled your evening.

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:20.361
No, that's... No, as long as you're okay.

00:21:20.529 --> 00:21:23.489
So I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:25.449
Mm-hm. Yeah.

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:33.874
See you.

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:47.930
What did you do?

00:21:58.317 --> 00:21:59.525
What you doing?

00:21:59.693 --> 00:22:01.736
Having a swim.

00:22:01.903 --> 00:22:03.904
What about the chick?

00:22:04.364 --> 00:22:05.906
Chicks don't swim.

00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:07.700
Are you sure?

00:22:09.453 --> 00:22:11.078
I don't know.

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:14.915
- Should we try?
- Sure.

00:22:22.424 --> 00:22:24.800
See, I told you. They don't swim.

00:22:25.552 --> 00:22:28.304
- Well, give him a minute.
- No.

00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:33.059
Oh, it's okay. It's okay, baby, baby, baby.
