WEBVTT

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.878
Oh, Phoebe, are you still on hold?

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:07.423
I was supposed to call my dad back,
like, two hours ago.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.091
Oh, yeah. He clicked on.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:11.218
He said call him as soon
as you get a chance.

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.762
- He's at Flimbees.
- What's Flimbees?

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.974
Oh, yeah, that's the word I use
when I can't remember the real thing.

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.978
Okay, hang up. That's it. Come on.

00:00:21.146 --> 00:00:23.397
No. Rachel,
that's what they want me to do.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:26.233
My warranty expires tomorrow.
If I don't get through...

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:29.111
...they're not gonna fix my crappy,
broken phone for free.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.447
We cannot let them win.
It's us versus them.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.115
Yes.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.577
- Hey.
Hi.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:39.580
Uh, listen, I gotta double-check
for tickets tonight. Who got what?

00:00:39.748 --> 00:00:41.248
I have one.

00:00:41.416 --> 00:00:43.959
I need two. I'm bringing Pete.

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:45.461
My boyfriend.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:49.590
I have a boyfriend now.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:51.550
Two it is. Ross, how about you?

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.845
Uh, yeah, I, uh... I also need two.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:00:57.556
Really? Who's number two?

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.016
Whose Number Two?

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:02.227
One of the more difficult games
sewer workers play.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.273
Uh, no one, it's just this person.

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:08.400
Like a date-type person?

00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:11.528
Yeah, kind of.
Uh, it's this woman from work.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:14.948
I hope that won't be too weird.
Will it, Rach?

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:18.911
No. No, not at all. I was actually
gonna bring someone myself so...

00:01:19.454 --> 00:01:21.872
But you said one ticket.

00:01:24.793 --> 00:01:27.127
I meant me plus one.

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:30.297
Okay. Did, uh, you guys mean
you plus one?

00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:34.426
- All right. I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:35.886
- Okay. Bye-bye.
Bye.

00:01:36.054 --> 00:01:37.304
Bye-bye.

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:38.889
Okay, I need a date.

00:01:40.809 --> 00:01:44.353
Oh, hey. You guys are finally
gonna get to meet Kate.

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:47.106
And I, uh, borrowed some of your cologne.
I hope she likes it.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:49.066
What are you doing?
That's never gonna happen.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:52.569
- She's seeing somebody.
- Yeah. And I don't have any cologne.

00:01:53.488 --> 00:01:56.949
- Green bottle next to the shaving cream.
- Oh. Worm medicine for the duck.

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.003
- Here you go. You can wear this.
- Thanks.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.005
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.634
Oh, I'm setting the phone down.

00:02:58.303 --> 00:03:00.220
But I'm still here.

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.348
Just don't go anywhere. I'm still here.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:07.603
Don't switch or anything,
because I'm right here. Just one sec.

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:11.565
One sec. One second.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.401
- Wait. One second. Just...
- Phoebe?

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.904
What? Monica, I'm scared.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:20.991
Okay. Honey, that's a sleeve, okay?

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.702
And we also have speakerphone.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.704
Please stay on the line.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:27.206
Your call is important to us.

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:29.416
You gotta hang up.
Because we're gonna be late.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.461
Thank you for your patience.
You're the next caller.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:35.297
Yes. Yes. I'm the next caller.

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:37.841
You were gonna have me hang up.

00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:40.969
Hey.

00:03:41.512 --> 00:03:43.847
Can you take a duck and a chick
to the theater?

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:46.516
- Of course not.
- No.

00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:49.770
Okay, I just wanted them to hear it
from somebody else.

00:03:57.278 --> 00:03:59.905
- Hey. Hey, Rach. Hi.
- Oh, hi, how are you?

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.532
- Good.
- Hey. Ha, ha.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.161
- Ahem. Looks like we're the first ones here.
- Yeah, looks that way.

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.537
First ones here.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.210
Hmm. Oh, Tommy, this is Ross.
Ross, Tommy.

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:16.004
Hey.
- Oh, I'm sorry. This is Cailin. Cailin...

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:17.798
- Sorry.
- Oh.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:19.758
- And break.
Ha-ha-ha.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.514
Okay, uh, I think I'm gonna run
to the ladies' room.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:28.433
- Okay. I'll get our seats.
I'll join you.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.354
So, uh... Well, this is, uh...

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:33.855
This is awkward.

00:04:34.023 --> 00:04:35.190
Yeah?

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:38.151
Well, you know, because Rachel and I
used to go out. Ha, ha.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.945
Oh, I didn't know that.

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:41.697
Oh.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:44.992
Well, then this is awkward.

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:49.705
- So, what do you? Oh. Yeah.
- I think we're here. Yeah.

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:51.331
Uh. Huh.

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.292
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.877
I think you may be in our seats.

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:59.256
Um, no, I don't think so.

00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:02.259
- Could we take a look at your ticket?
- Sure.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:06.722
Yeah. Yeah, see, this says, "D-13."

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:09.516
- And...
- Oh, well, I thought that...

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:13.979
You thought, huh? Yeah, well, that didn't
really work out too well for you. Idiot!

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:18.608
What are you, a moron? Huh?
It says, "D-13." Okay?

00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:21.987
Look, you're surrounded by even numbers.
Does that give you some clue?

00:05:22.447 --> 00:05:25.407
- Well, the usher told me...
- Oh. Oh, the usher must be right.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:29.244
What, with all his training they go through.
Get out!

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.204
Here.

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:37.252
- Hey, man, you want the aisle?
- No, I'm good.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.266
There he is.
There's our star.

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.018
You were great.

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:54.519
So? So? What'd you think?

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:58.648
Almost as good as the play with
the two naked girls on the seesaw.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.651
- I wasn't in that.
- I know.

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:05.906
Hey, Kate, listen I want you to meet
everybody. Everybody, this is Kate.

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:09.201
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Sweetheart.
- Hi.

00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:12.746
Come.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.460
So that's the girl you like.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.382
I'm telling you,
this guy Rachel is with is crazy, okay?

00:06:23.549 --> 00:06:26.259
He viciously screamed at total strangers.

00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:28.720
I think he's bad news.

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.683
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You don't like the guy Rachel's dating?

00:06:33.851 --> 00:06:35.018
Well, that's odd.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.773
Oh, hey, Lauren. Uh, you guys,
this is Kate's understudy, Lauren.

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.943
- Hi.
- Hey, gosh, you look so familiar.

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:45.987
Oh, yeah. I ran into you in the hallway
in your building.

00:06:46.155 --> 00:06:50.200
It was right after I slept with Joey.
He dumped me the next day.

00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:53.662
So how'd you guys meet?

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:58.125
Well, uh, the short version is,
I pursued her for a couple of months.

00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:01.294
Then I gave her a check for $20,000
and she was mine.

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:07.467
Yeah, and in the long version, I dump him
for telling people the short version.

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:11.221
Joey, sweetheart, you were fabulous.

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:14.516
Hey, you guys, this is my agent, Estelle.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:15.892
How do you do?

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.521
Oh, you two girls were outstanding.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:21.982
Do they have representation?

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.526
They weren't in the play.

00:07:24.694 --> 00:07:27.404
- Huh. We're not actors.
Oh. What a shame.

00:07:27.572 --> 00:07:30.031
Because with her face
and her chest...

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:31.950
...I could really put something together.

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:36.163
Could I borrow it?

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:40.459
Hi. Remember me?

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:43.503
Hi. Yeah. Ahem, Tommy's in line
for the bathroom...

00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:46.631
...and someone just cut in front of him.
I think he's gonna snap.

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:51.178
- Ross, I'm gonna go.
- Go? Why?

00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:53.889
I don't know.
Could be because I don't feel like...

00:07:54.056 --> 00:07:57.476
...standing around all night, waiting
for some guy who may or may not scream.

00:07:57.643 --> 00:08:00.061
Oh, but Cailin...

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.230
...he definitely will scream.

00:08:03.441 --> 00:08:04.524
Goodbye, Ross.

00:08:04.692 --> 00:08:06.735
Oh, go, all right.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:11.114
Here we go, people.

00:08:15.953 --> 00:08:19.289
Ahem, "Boxing Day.

00:08:19.457 --> 00:08:21.416
The Lucille Lortel Theatre... "

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:23.418
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da. Aha.

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:28.548
"Joey Tribbiani gives
an uneven performance.

00:08:28.716 --> 00:08:31.968
But Mr. Tribbiani is not the worst
thing in this production. "

00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:34.429
Yes. Ha-ha-ha!

00:08:36.807 --> 00:08:41.228
"Kate Miller's awkward and mannered
portrayal is laughable. "

00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:42.729
Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, aha!

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.814
Here it is. "The direction...

00:08:44.982 --> 00:08:48.276
...by Marshall Townend is... "

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.576
Thank you, boys and girls.

00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:59.120
You've ruined my life.

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:02.749
Please stuff your talentless faces...

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:06.253
...with my mother's crab cakes.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.255
Excuse me.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.845
Does anyone mind if I save this?

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:20.767
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:09:20.935 --> 00:09:22.852
- Oh, is the play over?
- Yeah, where were you?

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:25.063
Thank you for your patience.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.190
You're the next caller.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.027
You were the next caller five hours ago.
You must be going crazy.

00:09:31.195 --> 00:09:34.114
No, I've kept myself busy.

00:09:41.789 --> 00:09:45.041
Oh, okay, yeah, I put your stuff in
her room and her stuff in your room.

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:51.881
Hey.

00:09:52.174 --> 00:09:53.174
You okay?

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.510
Fabulous.

00:09:55.886 --> 00:10:00.765
Listen, drama critics, they're nothing but
people who couldn't make it as actors.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:03.226
- You know what you should do?
- Become a drama critic.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:10.233
I am hurt.

00:10:12.528 --> 00:10:14.195
A plague...

00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:17.198
...on both your houses.

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:22.746
By the way, he dumped me tonight
after he read my review.

00:10:22.913 --> 00:10:24.706
Oh, classy.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.791
Yep.

00:10:26.959 --> 00:10:29.252
I sure know how to pick them, huh?

00:10:30.421 --> 00:10:32.589
You know I gave up a part
on a soap for this?

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.424
Wow.

00:10:34.675 --> 00:10:37.719
Yeah, I, uh... I gave up a job too.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.764
- Really? What?
- Uh, declawing cats.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.560
Hey, tell you what,
let me walk you home.

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:49.939
We'll stop by every newsstand and burn
every copy of their Times and The Post.

00:10:50.149 --> 00:10:52.525
- Why The Post?
- You didn't see The Post?

00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:55.612
- No. You?
- No. Why?

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.997
You really think these newspapers
are just jealous of me?

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:09.376
Oh, absolutely. You're talented
and you're good-looking.

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:12.462
Aw, you're sweet and cute.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:15.048
I know. That's why they trashed me.

00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:24.474
- Wait. Wait a minute.
- What?

00:11:26.352 --> 00:11:28.186
I don't get you.

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:30.438
I mean, first you hate me.

00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:33.566
Then you sleep with me.

00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:36.653
Then you want nothing to do with me.
Now you want me again?

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.447
What? So you never went out
with an actress before?

00:11:40.866 --> 00:11:43.660
Kate, do you even like me?

00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:50.166
- Of course I do.
- So how come you blew me off?

00:11:50.334 --> 00:11:53.962
- You know, how come you were with him?
- I don't know.

00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:56.506
I just do this.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:59.551
I always have to pick, like,
the smartest guy...

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.303
...or the most talented guy.

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:05.390
Why can't I just pick someone like you?

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:09.978
Thanks.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.898
You know what I mean.

00:12:15.484 --> 00:12:17.944
I mean, like, the sweetest guy.

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:20.655
Joey, you're just so...

00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:24.075
You're so...

00:12:24.869 --> 00:12:26.244
...so...

00:12:34.086 --> 00:12:36.838
Okay. Okay, okay. Ha, ha.

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:41.009
Here we go.
Let's get your feet up there.

00:12:48.184 --> 00:12:49.893
Good night, Kate.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.479
Sweet dreams.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:02.489
I'm gonna put this can right here
in case you have to hurl.

00:13:11.123 --> 00:13:12.916
Please stay on the line.

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:15.210
Your call is very important to us.

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:19.798
Pheebs, you've been up for 24 hours.
Go to sleep, honey.

00:13:19.965 --> 00:13:22.967
- This isn't healthy.
- No, no, I'm fine.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:26.638
And you know why?
Because of all the riboflavin.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:31.059
- Hey.
Hey.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:34.062
Didn't you have that outfit on last night?

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.856
Yeah. I stayed at Kate's,
but, uh, nothing happened.

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:39.651
Hey, Pheebs, where were you?

00:13:39.819 --> 00:13:43.571
I'm so, so sorry, Joey.
I am definitely gonna see your play.

00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:47.367
I swear, your play is very important
to us. Thank you for your patience.

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:50.328
Your play is the next play
I'm gonna see.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.666
- Anyway, how'd it go with Kate?
- Oh, it was great.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.251
Yeah, I walked her home...

00:13:56.418 --> 00:13:59.712
...and it was amazing
how much we connected, you know?

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.422
Then she passed out.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.299
But then she woke up. Yeah.

00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:05.385
And we stayed up all night talking.

00:14:05.553 --> 00:14:08.263
And now we're, like, totally crazy
about each other.

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:12.350
- Joey, you had "the night. "
- What?

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:15.270
When two people finally realize
their feelings for each other...

00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:19.274
...and they talk for hours and they learn
all about the other person.

00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:20.483
You think?

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:23.611
- Ha, ha. Did you learn about her family?
- Two brothers. One died.

00:14:23.779 --> 00:14:25.613
- Yes.
Yeah.

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.997
This is from the woman at the bar.

00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:35.748
Oh.

00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:41.546
Sorry. She thought
you were somebody else.

00:14:45.175 --> 00:14:46.926
- What time is it?
- One.

00:14:47.094 --> 00:14:48.678
Seven-fifteen.

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:50.722
Watch doesn't work.

00:14:52.099 --> 00:14:55.310
Tommy's supposed to be here soon.
We're going to lunch.

00:14:57.813 --> 00:15:01.691
Look. Look, I wasn't gonna
say anything to you, but...

00:15:01.859 --> 00:15:05.528
All right, I don't think
you should be seeing Tommy anymore.

00:15:06.655 --> 00:15:07.864
- You don't?
No.

00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:12.452
The guy is mean. I mean, really mean.
I think you should stay away from him.

00:15:13.162 --> 00:15:16.998
Hmm. Or maybe I should stay away
from all men.

00:15:17.416 --> 00:15:19.667
No, it's not just because I'm jealous.

00:15:21.337 --> 00:15:24.255
I mean, I'm not, I'm not.
I'm not jealous, okay?

00:15:24.423 --> 00:15:25.965
Look, the guy, he screamed...

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:29.010
...he actually screamed
at this couple sitting in our seats.

00:15:29.178 --> 00:15:31.846
Yeah, and at the end of the play, he...

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:36.809
He got up, you know, and he just started,
like, banging his hands together.

00:15:39.271 --> 00:15:42.023
Okay, fine. Fine. You don't want
to believe me, no, that's fine.

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:44.943
- We're kidding. Ross.
- Ross. Ross.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:48.988
No one believe me.
I'm Mr. Funny to you. Mr. Funny.

00:15:49.156 --> 00:15:50.198
- Whoa.
- Sorry, Tommy.

00:15:50.866 --> 00:15:52.367
What's in the cup, Ross?

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:56.204
- Um.
- What is in the cup?

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:57.538
Okay, it's coffee.

00:15:57.706 --> 00:16:00.041
Iced coffee? Tell me it's iced coffee.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.712
- It's hot...
- Hot coffee!

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.508
You idiot! You gonna spill
hot coffee all over me, huh?

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:12.428
What are you? Just a big, stupid
doofy idiot with a doofy idiot hairdo?

00:16:12.596 --> 00:16:14.389
Huh? Huh?

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:19.811
What's your favorite thing
about summertime?

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:23.898
Hmm, going to the beach
when it stays light real late.

00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:25.400
Yeah.

00:16:26.402 --> 00:16:29.028
- Hey.
- Tommy.

00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:31.364
Say, what's your favorite thing
about summer?

00:16:31.532 --> 00:16:35.535
Ooh, I don't know.
Probably the, uh, smell of freshly cut grass.

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:37.578
- Aw, that's a good one.
- Yeah.

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:46.504
Hey, sorry. Sorry I'm late. My duck and
my chick had a fight. It was ugly.

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:49.382
- Look, we held the curtain for you. Let's go.
- Okay.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:58.433
Vic. Where have you been, baby?

00:17:02.229 --> 00:17:04.731
- Where's Kate?
- She got a job in L.A.

00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:07.066
What?

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:12.447
I've been waiting up all night
for you. Where have you been?

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:15.783
Where have you been, Vic?

00:17:16.618 --> 00:17:18.286
Oh, uh... Go to the window.

00:17:18.454 --> 00:17:21.664
I wanna run down to the truck
and show you something.

00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:26.461
What do you got down there, Vic?

00:17:26.628 --> 00:17:28.421
What do you got under that tarp?

00:17:32.342 --> 00:17:33.426
When is she leaving?

00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:36.345
Tonight. What are you doing?

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:39.807
I'm coming up.

00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:44.479
Hey, you mind if I use the phone?

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:52.862
Why don't you use ours across the hall
because she...

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.447
...has problems.

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:55.948
Thanks.

00:17:56.992 --> 00:17:58.659
Whoa. Whoa.

00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:02.747
Sorry, Tommy. I almost spilled
this hot coffee on you.

00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:05.666
Ha, ha. Yeah, but you didn't. Ha, ha.

00:18:05.834 --> 00:18:08.669
No, but it's hot.

00:18:12.633 --> 00:18:15.134
Ross, would you just stop it?
It's getting really old.

00:18:15.302 --> 00:18:17.345
I can't believe no one believes me.

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.097
I do. I believe you.

00:18:19.556 --> 00:18:20.640
You do, Pheebs?

00:18:20.808 --> 00:18:24.185
Yeah. But I also believed her
when she said I was next.

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.859
Ooh, hey.

00:18:32.236 --> 00:18:33.820
Hey there, little fella.

00:18:33.987 --> 00:18:36.364
Mr. Fuzzy-Man, how you doing?

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:40.368
Aw. Aw, ew. Oh. Ew.

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:42.203
Gross.

00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:44.122
Idiot!

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:47.333
Stupid, little, fuzzy, yellow creature!

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:51.462
"Oh, look at me. I'm so cute.
I'm a little chick who's disgusting!"

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:54.132
God, you're so stupid!
How are you not yet extinct?

00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:59.303
What are you quacking about?

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.055
Dumb Donald Dodo!

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:07.895
Step away from the duck.

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:13.192
Ooh, sorry, little Mr. Chickadee.

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.736
Sorry you went doody in my hand!

00:19:18.407 --> 00:19:20.575
Well, I guess we're not
going out anymore.

00:19:20.742 --> 00:19:22.118
Man!

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:27.748
- Joey.
- Kate.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:29.959
I'm so glad I caught you.
I couldn't find you before.

00:19:30.127 --> 00:19:32.336
What's going on?
What's all this about L. A?

00:19:32.504 --> 00:19:34.589
They still want me for General Hospital.

00:19:34.798 --> 00:19:37.550
But what about us?

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:41.679
Last night was wonderful.

00:19:42.097 --> 00:19:44.098
But I can't stay here just for you.

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:47.101
Well, so stay for the museums.

00:19:48.103 --> 00:19:50.354
- I'm sorry.
Joey, on-stage.

00:19:51.106 --> 00:19:53.274
Well, can you stay
till the end of the play?

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:56.277
I mean, I'll go to the airport with you.
I want to say goodbye.

00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:58.362
Where are you, Vic?

00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.698
Flight's in an hour. I gotta go.

00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:02.325
Vic?

00:20:02.492 --> 00:20:03.910
Vic?

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:07.455
- Vic!
- In a minute.

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:11.959
So this is it, Victor?

00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:15.755
Yeah. I guess it is.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.639
Listen, I, uh...

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:28.643
I gotta say goodbye, and I gotta say
it quick because this is killing me.

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:33.898
One thing you gotta know
is that I will never forget you.

00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:37.360
But you got things you have to do now.

00:20:37.527 --> 00:20:39.320
And so do I.

00:20:40.989 --> 00:20:42.531
And so...

00:20:44.493 --> 00:20:46.953
...I'm gonna get on this spaceship...

00:20:54.336 --> 00:20:57.797
...and I'm gonna go to Blaargon-7
in search of alternative fuels.

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:03.177
But when I return
200 years from now...

00:21:03.345 --> 00:21:05.471
...you'll be long gone...

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:08.557
...but I won't have aged at all.

00:21:11.853 --> 00:21:15.564
So you tell your great,
great granddaughter...

00:21:15.732 --> 00:21:16.899
...to look me up.

00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:21.070
Because, Adrianne...

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:22.780
...baby...

00:21:24.408 --> 00:21:26.534
...I'm gonna want to meet her.

00:21:34.293 --> 00:21:36.585
So long, Vic.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:46.345
Phoebe, it's been two days.

00:21:46.513 --> 00:21:48.055
Yeah, I know.

00:21:48.223 --> 00:21:51.225
Ugh, good thing it's one of those
801 numbers, right?

00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:56.480
Phoebe, 800 is toll free. 801 is Utah.

00:21:59.067 --> 00:22:00.192
No, no, no.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:03.863
It has to be 800 because all those
big companies have 800 numbers.

00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:05.406
Every...

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:09.201
Yeah, every big Utah-based company
has one.

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:10.578
Phoebe.

00:22:10.746 --> 00:22:13.831
Sorry. I'm so sorry. I will pay you back.

00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:16.834
