WEBVTT

00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:06.380
Hey, wouldn't it be cool if our duck
and our chick had a little baby?

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:08.674
We could call it Chuck.

00:00:10.343 --> 00:00:12.219
Or Dick.

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:15.681
- Hey.
Hey.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.392
Listen, I need a favor.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.729
I was in the shower, and as I was...

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:25.482
...cleansing myself, I, uh...
Well, I felt something.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:28.861
Was it like a sneeze, only better?

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:33.157
No, no. I mean, like, a thing on my body.

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:34.992
Well, what was it?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.954
Well, I don't know.
It's kind of in a place that's not...

00:00:39.122 --> 00:00:43.208
It's not visually accessible to me.
And I was hoping maybe you guys...

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.626
...could help me out.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:46.503
- Whoa!
- Whoa! No.

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.131
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:51.050
Hey, hey, hey.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.469
Huh.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:56.221
Well, what is it? Is it a mole?

00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.851
No, it's too wrinkly to be a mole.

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.228
Ew. Is it...? What, a pimple?

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:08.150
No, it's...

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:10.652
...fancier than a pimple.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.821
- Look, Ross, just go see a doc...
- Guys, what's...?

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:21.080
Okay, well, it's definite.
Two more weeks of winter.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.623
- Yeah, right.
- Ah.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:18.387
And, um, this is the coffeehouse.
This is where I play my music.

00:02:18.555 --> 00:02:20.556
- Good deal.
- Yeah, and these are my friends.

00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:22.975
People? This is Vince.
Vince, the people.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:24.309
Hi.

00:02:24.686 --> 00:02:27.312
- Hey.
- Vince is a fireman.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.941
Wow. Have you ever rescued anyone
from a burning building before?

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.569
Ninety-eight hot saves.
Highest on the force.

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.737
Well, you know, if Joey and I
play with matches...

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.823
...we could get you up to an even 100.

00:02:39.868 --> 00:02:42.536
- Fire safety is not a joke, son.
- Ha, ha. Oh.

00:02:44.622 --> 00:02:46.707
You're right. I know.

00:02:47.417 --> 00:02:49.543
Look, I gotta go. I'm on call tonight.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.670
- See you Saturday.
- Okay.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:55.674
Wow, he's cute, Pheebs.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.926
But I thought you just started dating
that teacher.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.178
- Oh, Jason?
Yeah.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.388
Uh-huh. We're seeing each other tonight.
Ahem.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.223
Well, Pheebs?

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:06.059
Two dates in one day?
That's so unlike you.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:09.730
I know, I know.
I'm, like, playing the field, you know?

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:13.817
I'm juggling two guys.
I'm sowing my wild oats, you know?

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:18.280
You know, this kind of, like, you know,
oat-sowing, field-playing juggler.

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:20.282
So, Pheebs, do they know
about each other?

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.243
Does a dog's lips move
when he reads?

00:03:27.665 --> 00:03:29.666
Okay, no, they don't know.

00:03:31.794 --> 00:03:33.712
- Hey, guys.
Hi.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.217
Well?
- How'd it go at the doctor's?

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:42.304
Well, he said there's definitely
nothing to worry about. It's totally benign.

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:44.806
- Well, what is it?
- He couldn't even tell me.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:50.604
He said it was just
some sort of skin abnormality.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:54.441
And the worse thing is, he said
not being able to identify it...

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.360
...he was reluctant to remove it.

00:03:56.527 --> 00:03:58.278
You know what?
You should go to my guy.

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:00.864
Because when I went in there
with my third nipple...

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.201
...he just lopped it right off, you know?
- Yeah?

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.328
- So I guess I'm lucky.
- Heh.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:10.540
I mean, not as lucky as people
who are born with two nipples.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:14.878
At least they knew what yours was.
You know? Yours had a name.

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:18.590
Oh. Maybe they'll name yours after you.

00:04:19.175 --> 00:04:21.843
You know? They'd call it The Ross.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:25.555
And then people would be, like,
"Oh, he's got a Ross. "

00:04:27.308 --> 00:04:29.309
Yeah, that'd be cool.

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.938
Pete's breaking up with me.

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:34.273
What?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.358
Yeah, I just checked my messages.

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.945
He said that when he gets back
from Atlanta, "We need to talk. "

00:04:40.363 --> 00:04:41.863
- And?
Well, that's it.

00:04:42.031 --> 00:04:45.409
People never say, "We need to talk,"
unless it's something bad.

00:04:45.576 --> 00:04:48.495
Whoa. That doesn't necessarily mean
he's breaking up with you.

00:04:48.663 --> 00:04:49.997
Yeah.
- Really?

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:52.833
Yeah. Maybe he just cheated on you.

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:01.675
And I know I'll never get rich doing it,
but I gotta tell you, it's pretty cool...

00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:04.386
...knowing you're making
a difference in a kid's life.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.555
That is so great.

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.433
- Oh, my God.
- Oh.

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.892
- Oh, my God!
- Ooh.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.395
- Uh, we'd better call the fire department.
- No. No.

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:16.565
- No, no?
- Well, we don't need a fireman.

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:18.734
We need, like, a good mechanic.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.238
Oh, my God. Here they come.
We gotta get out of here.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:24.489
Wait. Why?

00:05:24.657 --> 00:05:27.367
Look, if I wanted to see a fireman,
I would date one, okay?

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.122
That's all it is, a third nipple.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.917
You know? Just your
run-of-the-mill third nipple. Yeah.

00:05:36.085 --> 00:05:39.629
You can take it off.
Just slice that baby right off.

00:05:39.797 --> 00:05:42.924
Take your shirt off and let's see
what we're dealing with here.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.304
What are you doing?

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:52.726
Just showing you my run-of-the-mill,
slice-it-right-off third nipple.

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:55.729
- Well, that's not a third nipple.
- Oh?

00:05:55.897 --> 00:05:58.190
First of all, it's on your ass.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.525
Well, then what is it?

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.944
Wait a minute. Hold it.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:08.116
- Jansen, will you come in here a moment?
I'm with Hamilton.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:10.619
He's good with weird things.
Bring him in too.

00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:15.457
I gotta go water Pete's plants.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:19.795
You know what? If he's gonna break up
with me, maybe I won't water his plants.

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:23.882
Well, if he's gonna break up with you,
maybe Joey and I should water his plants...

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:28.804
...if you know what I mean.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.931
Or, ha, ha...

00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:33.433
...we could go over there
and pee on them.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:38.063
I can't take it, you know?

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:40.941
I'm always afraid one of them
is gonna catch me with the other.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.651
It's making me crazy.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:45.320
Well, honey, why don't you
break up with one of them?

00:06:45.488 --> 00:06:49.658
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happened to playing the field?

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:51.993
Well, it doesn't feel
like playing anymore.

00:06:52.161 --> 00:06:55.330
It's feels like work.
It's like I'm working in the field.

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:59.167
- So, Pheebs, pick one of them.
- Yeah, which one do you like more?

00:06:59.544 --> 00:07:03.672
Well, Vince is great, you know?
Because he's, like, a "guy" guy.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.968
You know?
He's just so burly, so very burly.

00:07:09.762 --> 00:07:12.514
Okay, good. So there you go.
Go with Vince.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:14.516
Yeah, but Jason's really sensitive.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:18.019
- Well, sensitive is important. Pick him.
- Yeah.

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:20.981
Oh, sure. Go with the sissy.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.317
Jason is not a sissy.

00:07:24.485 --> 00:07:26.695
Oh, no, no, no. I meant Chandler.

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:40.709
You know, I have dinner plans.

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:45.213
Thank you so much for coming
on such a short notice.

00:07:45.381 --> 00:07:49.468
Ladies and gentlemen, I've been
practicing medicine for 23 years...

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:52.262
...and I'm stumped.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.775
Okay, this is the den.

00:08:05.943 --> 00:08:08.487
All right, check this out. Lights.

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:12.073
Whoa. All right, less lights. Bad lights.

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:14.201
Lights, go away.

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.205
Aw, see? You just need
to find the right command.

00:08:18.372 --> 00:08:20.957
Yes. And the dimmer switch.

00:08:21.125 --> 00:08:24.503
Whoa. For a rich guy,
that's a pretty small TV.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.379
No, no, no. That's the videophone.

00:08:26.547 --> 00:08:30.258
But hey, guys, you're not supposed
to be here, so please don't touch anything.

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:33.720
IKEA, this is comfortable.

00:08:34.722 --> 00:08:36.973
This place is amazing.

00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:39.809
- Oh, God. That is the nicest kitchen.
- I know.

00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:41.520
No, no. It's the nicest kitchen.

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.939
The refrigerator told me
to have a great day.

00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:47.609
Look at this, a millionaire's checkbook.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.152
Joey, put that down.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:52.948
Oh, my God, that's Pete. Okay, get out.

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:56.284
- How the hell do you answer a videophone?
- Monica?

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.455
I guess that's how.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.249
Hey, Monica, how's it going?

00:09:02.416 --> 00:09:05.210
Oh, it's good. It's, um... It's good.

00:09:05.378 --> 00:09:07.128
Just here, watering the plants.

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:09.464
Well, don't forget that ficus
over there by Rachel.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:13.552
Ha. Chandler's on the couch.

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:18.306
Yeah, I see him. You guys
are just the worst hiders ever.

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:21.560
- Hi, Pete.
- How you doing?

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:23.311
Uh, Pete, um...

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:25.564
The other day when you said
you needed to talk...

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:29.317
...um, just so I know,
is it good news or bad news?

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:31.820
Oh, it's good news.
No, it's definitely good news.

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.573
Hold on a second, I have another call.

00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:36.157
Hey, how's it going?

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:38.118
No, no, no, it's still me.

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:40.203
No, it's not.
I've got picture-in-picture here.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:45.500
Yeah. Yeah, okay.
I'm gonna have to call you back later.

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:48.295
Monica? You.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:51.172
Oh. Oh, okay. Um, so I'll see you soon.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.341
- Okay. I love you.
- I love you.

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:55.885
We love you too.

00:09:57.179 --> 00:09:58.263
Okay.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.682
Well, it's good news. It's good news.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:04.060
- So, what do you think the good news is?
Look at this.

00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:08.565
He wrote a check for $50,000
to Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design.

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:12.861
Oh. Sorry. Uh, what do you think
the good news is?

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:16.656
Oh, my.

00:10:16.824 --> 00:10:18.825
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire.

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:22.704
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone.
Call Mom. Call Mom.

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:24.706
Hello?

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:27.208
And that's Pete's mom. Ha, ha.

00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:34.799
No, Mon, you have to make it
a theme wedding.

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:36.509
And the theme could be:

00:10:36.677 --> 00:10:38.845
"Look How Much Money We've Got. "

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:43.224
You know? I mean, you could put money
in the invitations.

00:10:43.392 --> 00:10:46.353
You could have, like,
little-money place settings.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.563
And, uh, you could start
with a money salad.

00:10:48.731 --> 00:10:52.400
I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.

00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:53.902
Would you stop?

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.364
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.
We don't know if he'll propose.

00:10:57.531 --> 00:11:00.116
Yes, but this is Pete, okay?
He's not like other people.

00:11:00.284 --> 00:11:01.993
On your first date, he took you to Rome.

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:06.164
For most guys, that's like
a third or fourth date kind of thing.

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:10.126
Well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.254
Monica's right. We're talking about
getting married here.

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:15.674
Okay? She can't just rush into this.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:19.219
Oh, what do you know?
You married a lesbian.

00:11:25.017 --> 00:11:27.519
All right. I gotta go.
I have to break up with Vince.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.854
Oh. So you're going with the teacher,
huh?

00:11:30.022 --> 00:11:33.858
Yeah. I like Vince a lot, you know?
But Jason is so sensitive, you know?

00:11:34.026 --> 00:11:37.445
And in the long run, I think
sensitive is better than having...

00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:41.700
...just, like, a really, really,
really nice body.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:47.205
Jason. Definitely Jason.

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:49.624
- Wish me luck.
Good luck.

00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:53.503
Oh, my God.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:12:00.635
Sorry. I was just imagining what it'd be like
to catch the money bouquet.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.852
Excuse me. Um, is Vince here?

00:12:09.019 --> 00:12:10.145
Oh, sure.

00:12:10.312 --> 00:12:11.604
- Vince.
Yo.

00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:17.819
Wow. I didn't know you guys
actually used those.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.113
So, what's up?

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.489
Um...

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:23.116
Wow.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.744
This isn't gonna be easy. Um...

00:12:26.996 --> 00:12:29.873
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.499
Uh-huh.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.502
Good deal.

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:37.672
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:42.719
It's just that, uh, I thought
we had something pretty special here.

00:12:42.887 --> 00:12:47.098
An you know, I felt like you were someone
I could finally open up to.

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:50.769
There's so much in me
I haven't shared with you yet.

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:54.981
- Oh, my God. I didn't know you were so...
- I'm sorry. I can't talk.

00:12:56.692 --> 00:12:58.985
I'm gonna go write in my journal.

00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:03.948
Wait. Wait. Wait.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:10.205
I'm telling you, if you wanna take care
of that thing, go see my herbal guy.

00:13:10.748 --> 00:13:15.043
Thank you, but I wanna remove it, Pheebs.
I don't wanna make it savory.

00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:19.964
You know, when girls sleep with guys
with weird things on their body...

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.300
...they tell their friends about it.

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:24.511
Give me that.

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:31.392
Hi. Okay, don't be mad at me,
but I couldn't resist.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:32.727
Bride's magazines?

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:35.605
Yes, and I know that you said
you'd say no if he asked you...

00:13:35.815 --> 00:13:38.942
...but I'm sorry, how great would you look
walking down the aisle...

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:41.236
...in this Donna Karan?

00:13:41.904 --> 00:13:44.322
Oh, you so would.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:46.115
Oh, you should get that anyway.

00:13:48.285 --> 00:13:49.869
Well, for clubbing.

00:13:51.038 --> 00:13:52.247
It is so weird.

00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:55.583
I know what I said. But, um, this morning...

00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:59.254
...I was lying in bed, I was imagining
what it'd be like to say yes.

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:05.426
I know it's a little sudden,
and it's rushed...

00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:08.179
...and it's totally not like me
to do something like this.

00:14:08.347 --> 00:14:11.432
But that doesn't mean I can't. Right?

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.393
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.145
And I know that we want
the same things.

00:14:16.313 --> 00:14:18.815
And when I thought
about saying yes...

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:20.817
...it made me really happy.

00:14:20.985 --> 00:14:22.777
Oh, my God.

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:25.989
I know.

00:14:26.156 --> 00:14:27.866
I need more pie.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:33.955
Hey, Mon, um, if you do get married,
can I bring two guests?

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:38.960
You didn't break up with that fireman?

00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:41.045
No, that was my way of telling you.

00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:44.632
Well, it turns out
he's incredibly sensitive.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.051
He keeps a journal and he paints.

00:14:47.219 --> 00:14:49.429
He even showed me charcoal drawings
that he drew of me.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:50.638
Wow.

00:14:50.806 --> 00:14:54.851
He'd prefer watercolors, but, you know,
he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.

00:14:57.813 --> 00:14:59.355
So then are you gonna dump Jason?

00:14:59.523 --> 00:15:02.817
Well, yeah, because I have to break up
with someone and...

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:06.988
Okay, so Jason is sensitive.
But now, so is Vince.

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:09.574
Plus Vince has the body. You know?

00:15:09.742 --> 00:15:11.159
So...

00:15:12.661 --> 00:15:15.371
It's really just about the math.

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:25.173
- Jason.
Yeah, come on in.

00:15:33.182 --> 00:15:35.058
Uh, Phoebe, you sounded serious
on the phone.

00:15:35.225 --> 00:15:37.226
Is, uh, anything wrong?

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:38.686
No.

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.163
You must be Ross.

00:15:58.082 --> 00:16:01.376
- Hi.
- I am Guru Saj.

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:08.049
Listen, I gotta tell you, I've never
been to a guru before, so...

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:11.135
Well, relax. If it makes you
feel any better, I've attended...

00:16:11.303 --> 00:16:14.639
...some of the finest medical schools
in Central America.

00:16:15.224 --> 00:16:18.726
Well, then, let's take a look
at this skin abnormality of yours.

00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:20.812
Come on, have a seat.

00:16:21.438 --> 00:16:23.231
Aha.

00:16:24.149 --> 00:16:27.860
Aha. As I suspected, it's a kundus.

00:16:30.072 --> 00:16:31.197
What's a "kundus"?

00:16:31.365 --> 00:16:34.951
I don't know. What's a kundus with you?

00:16:39.289 --> 00:16:40.832
Please lie down.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.918
I've got a salve that
ought to shrink that right up.

00:16:44.086 --> 00:16:46.254
Well, I guess it's worth a try.

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:48.506
Oh, sure. We should see results...

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.426
Whoa! Clearly not the way to go.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:54.512
What? What?

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.806
We appear to have angered it.

00:16:57.266 --> 00:16:59.225
We? We angered it?

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.479
Oh. I think I see the problem.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:07.608
And I'm afraid we're gonna
have to use a much stronger tool.

00:17:09.361 --> 00:17:10.778
Love.

00:17:11.947 --> 00:17:13.072
Oh, God.

00:17:14.408 --> 00:17:18.703
Ross, there is absolutely no way
this is gonna come off...

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:20.580
...unless you start to...
- Ow.

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:23.124
- Oops.
- What was that?

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.585
Well, it's gone.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:27.712
How's that?

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:29.922
Got caught in my watch.

00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:32.508
Hey, ha, ha.

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:36.721
Lights.

00:17:37.973 --> 00:17:40.058
Uh, romantic lights.

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:42.977
Ooh, nice. Ha, ha.

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:46.564
So, uh, there was this thing
I wanted to talk to you about.

00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:50.610
Oh, right.
I completely forgot about that.

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:53.321
Well, uh...

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:55.656
I've been doing a lot of thinking.

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:57.784
And I look at my life...

00:17:57.951 --> 00:17:59.494
Yeah?

00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:02.997
- And I feel like I've conquered
the business world.

00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:06.876
And I feel like I've conquered
the intellectual world.

00:18:08.003 --> 00:18:10.630
And now I have the most
beautiful woman in the world.

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.591
Wow.

00:18:14.676 --> 00:18:16.385
But there's one thing missing.

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:18.930
What's that?

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:23.559
It's time for me to conquer
the physical world.

00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:27.563
Okay.

00:18:28.857 --> 00:18:32.401
Monica? I wanna become...

00:18:32.861 --> 00:18:35.363
...the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:38.241
You wanna what?

00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:41.285
I wanna become
the Ultimate Fighting Champion.

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:44.080
It's the most intense
physical competition in the world.

00:18:44.248 --> 00:18:45.957
It's banned in 49 states.

00:18:46.542 --> 00:18:48.376
What are you talking about?

00:18:48.544 --> 00:18:50.211
Okay, my trainer, Hoshi, is teaching me...

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:53.047
...a combination of Jeet Kune Do
and Brazilian street-fighting.

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:56.592
I even had my own
octagon training ring designed.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.679
And I suppose you used
a ring designer for that.

00:19:00.055 --> 00:19:01.389
Yeah.

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:05.810
Monica, I want you there
in the front row when I win.

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.479
I want you close enough
to smell the blood.

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.150
What do you think?

00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:15.653
My parents will be so happy.

00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:23.828
Crazy underwear
Creeping up my butt

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:29.500
Crazy underwear
Always in a rut

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:32.336
Crazy underwear

00:19:33.964 --> 00:19:37.091
Oh, no. What is he doing here?

00:19:37.259 --> 00:19:39.177
All right, just keep playing,
just keep playing.

00:19:39.344 --> 00:19:42.013
You'll get through this. You'll be fine.

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:53.858
Okay, thank you.

00:19:54.526 --> 00:19:58.154
And as always, no one talk to me
after the show.

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:03.201
Hey.

00:20:03.368 --> 00:20:05.703
I just was passing by
and saw you were playing.

00:20:05.871 --> 00:20:07.538
This is kind of cool,
seeing you up there.

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.165
Well, hey.

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:11.125
Whoa, hey, hey.

00:20:11.293 --> 00:20:13.377
What's going on here? Who's this guy?

00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:18.049
I don't know. He just started
kissing me. Get him, Vince.

00:20:19.843 --> 00:20:21.260
What?

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:24.722
Yeah, okay, I've been dating both of you.

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:29.310
And it's been really horrible,
because, you know, it's been...

00:20:29.478 --> 00:20:31.729
...a lot of fun for me.

00:20:34.358 --> 00:20:37.360
But I like you both...

00:20:37.527 --> 00:20:39.987
...and I didn't know how to choose.

00:20:40.155 --> 00:20:43.950
So I'm sorry. I'm terrible.
I'm a terrible person. I'm terrible.

00:20:44.117 --> 00:20:47.620
Phoebe, Phoebe. Relax. It's okay.
I mean...

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:49.830
We never said this was exclusive.

00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:53.084
Yeah, neither did we.
So give yourself a break.

00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:55.044
Really?

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:58.339
Yeah, I mean, you know,
we haven't been going out that long.

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:02.051
Come on, we haven't even
slept together yet. Ha, ha.

00:21:02.344 --> 00:21:03.719
You haven't?

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:09.934
- You have?
- Okay, well, this is none of my business.

00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:15.856
I can't believe this. You slept with him?

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:18.818
Well, I made you
a candlelight dinner in the park.

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:22.989
You know, Phoebe,
I'm gonna make this real easy for you.

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:32.123
Well, that could've been really awkward.

00:21:35.252 --> 00:21:38.129
You made him a candlelight dinner
in the park?

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:42.133
Yeah, but I can do that for you.
I'm gonna do that for you.

00:21:42.301 --> 00:21:44.552
You know, I can't believe
I went out with somebody...

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.597
...who'd actually have an open flame
in the middle of a wooded area.

00:21:57.691 --> 00:22:00.401
Everything's gonna be all right.

00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:03.237
Okay, Dick?

00:22:05.907 --> 00:22:07.783
Hello. I am Guru Saj.

00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.744
Whoa.

00:22:11.288 --> 00:22:13.456
He's supposed to be a duck, right?
Because otherwise...

00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:16.000
...this is way out of my league.

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:20.838
Yeah, yeah. He's got a really bad cough,
and our vet, he can't do anything about it.

00:22:21.006 --> 00:22:23.132
- Is there something you can do?
- Hmm.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:27.887
Let me see.

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.682
Do you think you could get him
to eat a bat?
