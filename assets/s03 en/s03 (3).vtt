WEBVTT

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.769
See, Joe, that's why your parents
told you not to jump on the bed.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.865
Hey, look at me. I'm making jam.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:19.286
- I've been at it since 4:00 this morning.
- Where'd you get fruit at 4 in the morning?

00:01:19.496 --> 00:01:20.913
Went down at the docks.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.040
Bet you didn't know
you can get it wholesale.

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:24.917
I didn't know there were docks.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.128
Hey.

00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:30.089
- Aw, is it broken?
- Aw.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.800
No, but I gotta wear this thing
for a couple weeks.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:36.095
Did you tell the doctor you did it
jumping up and down on your bed?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.390
No. I had a whole story
worked out, but then...

00:01:40.558 --> 00:01:41.850
...Chandler sold me out.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.102
I'm sorry, Joe.

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:47.022
I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy
that it just fell out of his socket.

00:01:48.608 --> 00:01:50.859
What is this? Fruit?

00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:55.364
Monica's making jam.

00:01:56.032 --> 00:02:00.410
Jam? I love jam. Hey, how come
we never have jam at our place?

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:02.746
Because the kids need new shoes.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:07.960
I'm going into business, people.
I'm sick of being depressed about Richard.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.879
I needed a plan.
A plan to get over my man.

00:02:11.047 --> 00:02:14.091
What's the opposite of man? Jam.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.095
Joey, don't. It's way too hot.

00:02:25.395 --> 00:02:27.396
This will just be my batch.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:48.125
Um, that's it. No.
Hey you. J. Crew guy...

00:02:48.376 --> 00:02:50.127
Yeah. Why are you following me?

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:52.629
All week long, everywhere I look,
there's you.

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.883
You wouldn't return my calls.
You sent back my letters.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.886
- What?
- One more chance, Ursula. Please.

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:02.389
Oh. Oh.

00:03:02.557 --> 00:03:03.640
Oh. Well, this is awkward.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.475
- Why?
- Um...

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:09.438
Yeah, because you want Ursula,
and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.274
Seriously.

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:16.153
Oh. That's great.
I'm stalking the wrong woman.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:19.031
I am such a dingus!

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.200
Oh, you're not a dingus.

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.995
I just... I want you to know
I didn't used to be like this.

00:03:25.163 --> 00:03:27.414
Before I met your sister,
I was, like, this normal guy...

00:03:27.582 --> 00:03:29.625
...who sold beepers
and cellular phones.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:34.296
Well... I mean, look, it's not your fault,
you know?

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:37.257
I mean, this is just
what she does to guys, okay?

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:38.717
Just...

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:41.470
Well, thanks.

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:43.972
Wait. You know what?
I got a little story.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.141
When I was in junior high school...

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:48.769
...I went through this period
where I thought I was a witch.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.647
And there was this guidance counselor
who said something to me...

00:03:51.814 --> 00:03:53.482
...that I think will help you a lot.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.236
He said, "Okay, you're not a witch.
You're just an average student. "

00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.365
- See what I'm saying?
- Not really.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.034
Um, well, get over it.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:10.165
I mean, you just...
You seem like a really nice guy.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.835
You know, I just...
Don't be so hard on yourself, okay?

00:04:14.045 --> 00:04:18.215
Wait, you're right. I know you're right.
And thanks for being so nice.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.550
- Here.
- Aah!

00:04:21.052 --> 00:04:22.594
Thanks a lot.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:24.846
Do you wanna get a cup of coffee or...?

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:27.015
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.353
You don't have to
walk behind me anymore.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:32.562
Sorry.

00:04:34.232 --> 00:04:35.899
- Mon?
- Mon?

00:04:38.027 --> 00:04:41.446
"Gone for more jars.
Back later. Monica Geller. "

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.950
Wait a minute. Look.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:46.743
- Look, look, look.
- What, what, what?

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:49.204
- It's an empty apartment.
- Mm.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.707
We're all alone
in an empty apartment.

00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:55.919
Aw, honey, come on. I have to be
at work in, like, 10 minutes and, oh...

00:04:56.754 --> 00:05:01.091
All right. Well, it's not like
I'm employee of the year or anything.

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:03.343
Ha, ha. Whoo!

00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:07.639
- There it is.
Oh.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:09.766
- Oh, that's what you're talking about.
Ahem.

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:11.727
Hey.
- Hey.

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:13.645
Do I look fat?

00:05:14.397 --> 00:05:15.772
No.

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.941
Okay, I accept that.

00:05:18.109 --> 00:05:19.901
When Janice asked me and I said no...

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.988
...she took that to mean
that I was calling her a cow.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.075
Okay, walk us through it, honey.
Walk us through it.

00:05:27.243 --> 00:05:28.744
Okay, well, Janice said, uh:

00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:31.913
"Hi. Do I look fat today?"
And I looked at her...

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:33.707
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.542
You looked at her?

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.629
- You never look.
- Mm-mm.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:44.968
You just answer. It's like a reflex.
"Do I look fat?" "No. "

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:50.432
"Is she prettier than I am?" "No. "

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:52.768
- "Does size matter?"
- No.

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:54.603
And it works both ways.

00:05:57.648 --> 00:06:00.859
Okay, so you both just know this stuff?

00:06:01.027 --> 00:06:04.404
You know, after about 30 or 40 fights,
you kind of catch on.

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.616
Okay. For instance, ahem:

00:06:07.784 --> 00:06:12.120
Let's say Janice is coming back from a trip
and she gives you two options.

00:06:12.288 --> 00:06:15.457
Option number one:
She'll take a cab home from the airport.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:19.378
Or option two: You can meet her
at baggage claim. What do you do?

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:20.670
That's easy. Baggage claim.

00:06:20.838 --> 00:06:22.756
Ehh! Wrong. Now you're single.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:28.595
It's actually secret option number three.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:32.057
You meet her at the gate.
That way she knows you love her.

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:34.476
Hmm.
- Okay, this is good. This is good.

00:06:34.644 --> 00:06:38.563
All right, listen, I have one.
Janice likes to cuddle...

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:41.024
...at night, which I'm all for.
- Mm.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:44.986
But, uh, you know, when you want
to go to sleep, you want some space.

00:06:45.154 --> 00:06:47.989
So, uh, you know,
how do I tell her that without...

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:51.243
...you know, accidentally
calling her fat or something?

00:06:51.661 --> 00:06:56.039
Oh. Honey, I'm sorry. We can't help you
there, because we're cuddly sleepers.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.167
- Okay, I'm late for work.
- Oh.

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:02.838
- Are you guys gonna come down?
- Uh, yeah. I'm right behind you.

00:07:03.005 --> 00:07:05.215
- Good luck, Chandler.
Thank you, Rachel.

00:07:05.383 --> 00:07:07.050
Bye, sweetie.
- Bye, honey.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:11.054
Okay, the sleeping thing.

00:07:11.973 --> 00:07:14.558
Very tricky business
but there is something you can do.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:17.894
- I thought you were cuddly sleepers.
- No.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.524
No, not cuddly. Not me. Just her.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.943
I'm like you. I need the room. Ahem.

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.529
Okay, come here. Ahem.

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:32.117
Okay. You're in bed.

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:33.618
Yeah?

00:07:37.248 --> 00:07:39.624
- I'm gonna use the cushion.
- Yeah.

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:45.338
Okay. You're in bed.
She's over on your side cuddling.

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:48.550
Now, you wait for her to drift off...

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.219
...and then you hug her...

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:56.141
...and roll her over
to her side of the bed.

00:07:56.309 --> 00:07:58.435
And then you...

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.189
...roll away.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.358
Hug for her.

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:10.906
Roll for you.

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:13.742
- Okay, the old "hug and roll. "
- Yep.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.994
- Okay. One question.
- Shoot.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.538
You're pretending
the pillow's a girl, right?

00:08:21.626 --> 00:08:22.959
Remember when you were a kid...

00:08:23.127 --> 00:08:25.337
...and your mom would
drop you off at the movies...

00:08:25.588 --> 00:08:28.423
...with a jar ofjam and a little spoon?

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.345
You're so pretty.

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:40.393
- Hi.
Hey, Phoebe.

00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:44.314
Hey, oh! You know that guy who's been
following me? I talked to him today.

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:47.150
You talked to him?
Are you crazy?

00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:52.989
Okay, first, I'm not crazy.
And second, say it. Don't spray it.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:57.744
Anyway, his name is Malcolm,
and he wasn't following me.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.789
I mean, he was, but just because
he thought I was Ursula. Ick.

00:09:03.292 --> 00:09:07.337
And that's why... That's why he
couldn't just come up and talk to me.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:09.798
Because of the restraining order.

00:09:11.676 --> 00:09:14.678
Hmm. Not feeling better about Malcolm.

00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:18.390
Oh! No, no, no, he's not like a kook.

00:09:18.558 --> 00:09:22.686
No, he's just this, like, very passionate,
incredibly romantic guy...

00:09:22.853 --> 00:09:25.564
...that just got a teensy bit
carried away, you know?

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:28.817
And we just get along really well,
and he's so cute.

00:09:29.777 --> 00:09:34.906
Oh, my God. You've got a crush
on your sister's stalker.

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:38.034
No, I'm just gonna help him, you know,
get "de-Ursula-ized. "

00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:41.121
Like, you know... Like I did for Joey
after he went out with her.

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:43.665
Yeah, but I didn't stalk her. I mean...

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.750
I asked for the news,
not the weather.

00:09:47.837 --> 00:09:50.755
- Hey, guys.
Hey, Mon.

00:09:50.923 --> 00:09:54.217
Joey, this is for you.
It's blackberry currant.

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:55.677
Aw.

00:09:57.847 --> 00:09:59.222
Oh.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.557
Yeah.

00:10:01.058 --> 00:10:02.851
Hey, Joe, I gotta ask.

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:06.229
The girl from the Xerox place,
buck naked...

00:10:06.814 --> 00:10:09.357
...or a big tub of jam?

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:12.569
Put your hands together.

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:19.242
Joey, take your time with that.
That's my last batch.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.453
No more jam?

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:24.581
What happened to your jam plan?

00:10:24.832 --> 00:10:28.335
Well, I figured out I'd need to charge
17 bucks a jar just to break even.

00:10:28.669 --> 00:10:31.838
So I've got a new plan now. Babies.

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:35.508
Well, you're gonna need
much bigger jars.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:41.556
- What are you talking about?
- About me having a baby.

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:43.767
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

00:10:43.934 --> 00:10:47.646
The great thing about the jam plan was
I was take control of my life.

00:10:47.813 --> 00:10:50.690
So I asked myself, "What is
the most important thing to me?"

00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:53.568
And that's when I came up
with the baby plan.

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:56.571
Well, aren't you forgetting something?

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:59.949
What is, uh...?
What is that guy's name? Dad.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:04.996
It took me 28 years to find one man
that I wanted to spend my life with.

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:09.167
If I have to wait another 28 years,
then I'll be 56 before I can have a baby.

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.336
And that's just stupid.

00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:14.756
That's what's stupid?

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:21.262
I don't need an actual man.
Just a couple of his best swimmers.

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:25.809
You know? And there are places
that you can go to get that stuff.

00:11:25.976 --> 00:11:28.019
Down at the docks again?

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.782
Night-night, Bing-a-ling.

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:43.993
Night-night...

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.413
...Janice.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.961
Look at all that room on her side.

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.004
You could fit a giant penguin over there.

00:11:57.174 --> 00:11:58.883
That'd be weird, though.

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:01.886
Hug and roll time.

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:04.347
I'm hugging. I'm hugging.

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:07.308
You're rolling, and...

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:09.561
Yes! Freedom!

00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:12.147
Except for this arm.

00:12:12.314 --> 00:12:15.066
I'm stuck. Stuck arm.

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:19.696
Okay, time for the old tablecloth trick.
One fluid motion.

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.698
Quick like a cat. Quick like a cat.

00:12:21.866 --> 00:12:24.993
And one, two...

00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:26.619
...three.

00:12:33.753 --> 00:12:35.003
Here's my binoculars.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.630
Oh, great. Great. You're doing great.

00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:41.009
You know, real strong. Going strong.
Keep going.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:43.970
These are my night-vision goggles.

00:12:44.972 --> 00:12:48.349
This is the book I pretend to read
when I'm watching her in the park.

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:52.479
And these are Madlibs.
They're just for fun.

00:12:52.646 --> 00:12:54.689
Oh, yeah. Ha, ha. What's this?

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:59.569
Oh. This is the log I kept,
recording her every movement.

00:13:00.196 --> 00:13:03.698
- You want to hear something from it?
- Um, not even a little bit.

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:07.160
- It's about you.
- Oh, okay, then.

00:13:13.083 --> 00:13:15.251
- "I met Phoebe today.
- Ha, ha.

00:13:15.419 --> 00:13:17.879
She was really nice to me
even though I'm such a loser. "

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.255
Oh.

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:23.092
"And then when I was walking home,
I thought about her a lot.

00:13:23.385 --> 00:13:26.387
It was weird but kind of cool. "

00:13:27.556 --> 00:13:28.932
Good. Ha, ha.

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:31.726
So, what were you thinking?

00:13:33.103 --> 00:13:35.730
I was thinking what it'd be like
to kiss you.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.065
- Really?
- No.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:38.483
Oh.

00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:43.905
See, that's just something I said now
so that maybe I could kiss you.

00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:46.324
- Oh, okay.
- Ha!

00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:55.124
No, it's all right.
I just had a jar of mustard.

00:13:56.585 --> 00:14:01.714
Okay. Sperm donor number 03815,
come on down!

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:04.592
Okay, he's 6'2", 170 pounds.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.804
And he describes himself
as a male Geena Davis.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:10.056
You mean there's more than one of us?

00:14:12.142 --> 00:14:15.353
You can't do this, Mon, all right?
If you do this, I'm gonna...

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.314
- You're gonna what?
- I'm gonna tell Mom.

00:14:19.108 --> 00:14:22.777
Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right.
I love you, but you're crazy.

00:14:22.945 --> 00:14:25.947
- Crazy.
- What? Why? Why is this crazy?

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:28.825
- So this isn't the ideal way to do something...
- Oh, it's not...

00:14:28.993 --> 00:14:31.035
Lips moving. Still talking.

00:14:32.162 --> 00:14:33.830
It may not be ideal...

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.291
...but I'm so ready.

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:39.168
You know, I see the way
Ben looks at you.

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.796
It makes me ache, you know?

00:14:42.006 --> 00:14:44.132
Check it out. Jam crackers.

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.722
Okay. All right, how's this?

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.933
Twenty-seven. Italian-American guy.

00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:55.768
He's an actor.

00:14:55.936 --> 00:14:57.687
Born in Queens.

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:01.441
Wow. Big family. Seven sisters...

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:05.194
...and he's the only boy.

00:15:08.282 --> 00:15:11.910
Oh, my God. Under personal comments:
"New York Knicks rule. "

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:13.620
Yeah, the Knicks rule.

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:19.667
Joey, this is you.

00:15:20.127 --> 00:15:21.502
Let me see.

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:25.006
Oh, right.

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:28.176
When did you go to a sperm bank?

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:31.137
Right after I did that sex study at NYU.

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:33.932
Hey, remember that sweater
I gave you for your birthday?

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.517
And that's how you bought it?

00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:40.480
No. That's what I was wearing
when I donated.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:46.235
I'm kind of surprised
there's any of my boys left.

00:15:46.403 --> 00:15:48.613
Well, honey, it is pretty competitive.

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:51.366
I mean, I've got an actual
rocket scientist here.

00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.284
Hey, maybe I should call this place...

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.954
...and get them to put my
Days ofour Lives gig on here.

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:57.872
You know? Juice this puppy up a little.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.250
Hey!
- Hello.

00:16:01.418 --> 00:16:02.669
How's the maniac?

00:16:02.836 --> 00:16:06.130
Oh, he's yummy.
We did a little kissing. Aah!

00:16:07.299 --> 00:16:08.716
Phoebe, what are you doing?

00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:10.551
Oh, no, no, no. You know what?

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:13.888
He's not into that anymore.
He quit for me. Mm-hm.

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:17.725
Pheebs, this guy has been
obsessed with your sister...

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:19.894
...for God knows how long, okay?

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:22.063
You don't just give up something
like that.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:25.692
Look, he gave me his night-vision
goggles and everything.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:30.655
You're taking the word of a guy
who has night-vision goggles?

00:16:30.823 --> 00:16:34.701
What? He's not still following her.
You think he's still following her?

00:16:34.868 --> 00:16:37.954
Pheebs, wake up and smell
the restraining order.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.249
What should I do?

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:44.502
I think that if you really like this guy,
you should just trust him.

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:45.920
Thank you, Monica.

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:48.673
Or you could follow him
and see where he goes.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.175
Oh, that's what I would do. Forget mine.

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.680
Oh, my God. What happened?

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:58.433
Oh, God. Crazy Chandler,
he spun me...

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.393
...off the bed.

00:17:00.644 --> 00:17:04.272
- Wow. Spinning. That sounds like fun.
- Oh.

00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:07.108
I wish.

00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:11.404
No, you know, he was just trying
Ross' "hug and roll" thing.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:15.491
Ross' what?

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:20.038
You know, like, where he hugs you
and then he kind of rolls you away, and...

00:17:22.958 --> 00:17:27.045
Oh, my God.

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:02.538
- Phoebe?
- Yes? Yes! Oh.

00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:04.791
What are you doing?

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:07.585
Oh, I was just here
looking for my, um...

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:11.631
My part of an old sandwich.
Here it is! Oh!

00:18:13.509 --> 00:18:15.176
Were you following me?

00:18:15.844 --> 00:18:17.261
Um, perhaps.

00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:20.223
Yes. Yes. I'm sorry.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.102
I'm sorry. I was just afraid
that you were still hung up on my sister.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.437
So you spied on me.

00:18:27.106 --> 00:18:29.232
I can't believe you don't trust me.

00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:39.534
Oh, well, what do you know?
There goes my identical twin sister.

00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:42.328
Just walking along, looking like me.

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:47.667
What is this, just a freakish coincidence,
or did you know that she takes this train?

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.628
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:18:50.796 --> 00:18:53.047
I tried to stop, but I couldn't.

00:18:53.423 --> 00:18:55.466
I'm so pathetic.

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:59.804
No, no, it's not your fault.
You know, it's partly my fault.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:02.348
It's because I made you quit cold turkey.

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:03.766
It's too hard, you know?

00:19:03.934 --> 00:19:07.937
Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you
anymore, because you're, you know:

00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:09.605
Wow!

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:15.236
But, um... But I will definitely, definitely
help you get over my sister. Okay?

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:18.447
Just stalk me for a while, huh?

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:22.869
Yeah, and I'll be like an Ursula patch.

00:19:23.036 --> 00:19:24.871
Uh-huh. I don't know.

00:19:25.038 --> 00:19:27.748
Yeah, just... Okay, look, I'm going.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:29.208
Um, come on.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.255
Ooh, ooh, behind the pillar.
Ooh, which way am I gonna go? Aah!

00:19:36.049 --> 00:19:37.258
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:39.010
- Where you going?
- To the bank.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.804
Huh. Sperm or regular?

00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:44.765
Sperm.

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:46.309
So you're really doing it, huh?

00:19:46.476 --> 00:19:49.854
Oh, yeah. I picked a guy, 37135.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:51.147
He sounds nice.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:54.275
I'd say so.
He's got brown hair and green eyes.

00:19:54.443 --> 00:19:56.360
No kidding? Hmm.

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:59.280
- What?
- I figured you'd have picked a blond guy.

00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:01.240
Really? Why?

00:20:01.408 --> 00:20:03.284
I don't know.
I always pictured you ending up...

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:06.954
...with one of those tall, smart, blond guys,
name like...

00:20:07.122 --> 00:20:08.122
...Hoyt.

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:12.001
- Hoyt?
- It's a name. Yeah.

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:17.798
I saw you in this... You know,
this great house with a big pool.

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:20.676
- Yeah? Is he a swimmer?
- Ha.

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:23.554
He's got the body for it. Ha, ha.

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:25.806
I like that.

00:20:28.143 --> 00:20:31.562
- Ha, ha. What?
- You guys have one of those signs that says:

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:34.440
"We don't swim in your toilet,
so don't pee in our pool. "

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:36.692
We do not have one of those signs.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.444
Sure you do. It was a gift from me.

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:42.907
Oh! And you have three great kids.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:46.160
- Two girls and a boy?
- Yeah!

00:20:46.703 --> 00:20:49.163
And they wear those little water wings,
you know...

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:50.998
...and they're running around
on the deck.

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:54.085
And then Hoyt wraps this big towel
around all three of them.

00:20:54.253 --> 00:20:55.670
Sure.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:04.595
Uh, but, hey, you know,
this way sounds good too.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.682
Yeah.

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:12.853
Oh, Monica.

00:21:20.153 --> 00:21:22.363
Wow, this guy's an astronaut?

00:21:24.032 --> 00:21:26.284
That would have been cool...

00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:28.911
...for, like, a day. Ah-ah!

00:21:36.044 --> 00:21:37.420
I called the sperm bank today.

00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:40.840
They haven't sold a single unit
of Tribbiani.

00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:42.883
Nobody wants my product.

00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:47.013
I mean, I don't get it, you know?

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.518
I mean...

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:55.313
...maybe if they met me in person.

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.733
Uh, honey, you got a little thing on your...

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.068
- Oh.
Yeah.

00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:05.114
Get it?

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.074
Yeah.

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:13.456
Hello.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:18.627
Hey.

00:22:19.838 --> 00:22:21.088
Uh...

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:24.133
Chan, can I, uh...?
Could I talk to you for a second?

00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.385
- Sure. What's up?
- Uh, ha, ha.

00:22:26.553 --> 00:22:29.347
Just one, uh...
One additional relationship thought.

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:32.475
Um, something you're probably,
uh, already familiar with.

00:22:32.642 --> 00:22:34.352
Uh, women talk.
