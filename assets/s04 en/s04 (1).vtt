WEBVTT

00:00:02.252 --> 00:00:05.546
Okay, so we went to the beach because
Phoebe found out about this lady...

00:00:05.714 --> 00:00:06.922
...who knew her mom and dad...

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.383
...and I don't really know
what happened with that.

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:11.552
- I'm your mother.
- Huh?

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.430
Monica joked that she wouldn't
go out with a guy like Chandler.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.098
- Hi there.
- He couldn't let it go.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:20.394
I don't really know what happened with that.
And then Ross' new girlfriend shows up...

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.771
...and Rachel convinced her
to shave her head.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.565
And then Ross and Rachel kiss.

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.401
And now Ross has to choose
between Rachel and the bald girl.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.404
And I don't know what happened
there either.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:32.823
You know what? Hold on.
Let me go get Chandler.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.795
Hi.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:48.464
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.718
Rachel was just helping me out.
My head got all sunburned.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:54.470
Aw.

00:00:55.513 --> 00:00:58.724
- Thanks a million.
- Oh, you're welcome a million.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.643
- Okay, I'll be in our room.
- Uh.

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:15.532
Oh, my God.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.326
I know.

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:23.874
- Okay, I gotta go.
- Whoa. What? Why?

00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.919
Uh, I gotta go break up with Bonnie.

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:29.088
Here? Now?

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.465
Well, yeah, I can't stay here all night.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:34.718
And if I go in there,
she's gonna want to...

00:01:34.886 --> 00:01:35.928
...do stuff.

00:01:37.347 --> 00:01:39.765
Can't you just tell here
that you are not in the mood?

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.433
No, she likes that.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.937
Ha, ha. Yeah, faking sleep
doesn't work either.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:47.356
I can't tell you how many mornings
I woke up with her...

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.024
- Oh.
- Oh, okay.

00:01:49.192 --> 00:01:54.279
- Ha, ha. Yeah, why am I telling you?
- I don't know. Ha, ha.

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:02.538
Uh, uh...

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:05.124
- It wasn't every morning...
- Oh, making it worse.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.583
Okay.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.761
So I guess you'd like to know
how it all happened.

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:02.472
I mean, well, I think I can figure it out.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.932
I guess, you know, I was born...

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.476
...and then everyone
started lying their asses off.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:09.771
No, no, it wasn't like that.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:13.442
I mean, remember how I told you
how Lily and Frank and I, we were close?

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.361
Well, we were very close.

00:03:16.529 --> 00:03:17.988
How close?

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:21.867
Well, the three of us,
we were kind of a, um... A couple.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:26.038
- I don't even know how that would work.
- Well, we...

00:03:26.206 --> 00:03:27.331
I'm not asking.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.919
Well, anyhow, somehow I got pregnant...

00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:33.629
...and I was...

00:03:33.963 --> 00:03:37.591
...scared. I was stupid and selfish and...

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:39.509
I was 18 years old.

00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:42.763
I mean, you remember what it was like
to be 18 years old, don't you?

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.807
Yeah. Let's see, my mom had killed herself
and my dad had run off.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:49.978
And I was living in a gremlin with a guy
named Cindy, who talked to his hand.

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:53.690
Oh, I'm so sorry.

00:03:53.858 --> 00:03:56.610
I thought I was leaving you
with the best parents in the world.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.988
I didn't even hear about your mom and dad
till a couple of years ago.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.074
And by then, you were already grown-up.

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.826
I don't know. You're here
and I would really...

00:04:04.994 --> 00:04:06.870
I would like to get to know you.

00:04:07.038 --> 00:04:10.123
Yeah, well, everybody does. Ha, ha.

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:12.334
I'm a really cool person.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.753
And you know, you had 29 years
to find that out...

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.421
...but you didn't even try.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.801
You know what? You walked out on me,
and I'm gonna do the same to you.

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.388
- Wait.
- Okay? I don't ever want to see you again.

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.102
Where's my purse?

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.273
Shoot. We're out of soda.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.191
Oh, I'll go out and get you some.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:39.278
- Really?
- No, because I'm not your boyfriend.

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:43.532
Hey, Pheebs, how'd it go?

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.617
Huh. Well, ahem...

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:49.246
My mom's friend, Phoebe,
is actually my birth mom.

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:55.002
I found a dried-up seahorse.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.379
Sweetie, what are you talking about?

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:00.632
Oh, my new mom,
who's a big fat abandoner.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.050
Oh, wait, Pheebs.

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:05.387
Wait a second. Don't you want to stay here
and talk about it?

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.472
No. I just... I wanna...

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.641
I need to be alone.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.313
- Monica.
- Oh.

00:05:23.906 --> 00:05:24.906
It's over.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:30.120
- Oh. Was it awful?
- Well, it was long.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.331
I didn't even realize how late it was...

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:35.042
...till I noticed the five o'clock shadow
on her head.

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:45.385
Anyway, she didn't want to stay.
I called a cab. She just left.

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:54.644
I wrote you a letter.

00:05:54.812 --> 00:05:57.689
Oh, thank you. Ha, ha.

00:05:58.316 --> 00:06:00.233
I like mail.

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:06.823
There's just some things
I've been thinking about.

00:06:06.991 --> 00:06:08.575
You know, things about us.

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:11.661
And before we can even think
about the two of us getting back together...

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:15.374
...I just need to know
how you feel about this stuff.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.670
- Okay. Heh.
- Okay.

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:25.717
Well, it's...

00:06:25.885 --> 00:06:28.053
It's 5:30 in the morning. Heh.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:35.310
So I'd better get cracking on this baby.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.481
So I'll be waiting for you.
Just come up when you're done.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.651
Okay. I'll be up...

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:44.903
...in 18 pages.

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:48.365
Front and back.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.119
Very exciting.

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:11.221
Oh, oh.

00:07:16.727 --> 00:07:17.978
Hey.

00:07:18.146 --> 00:07:20.480
What happened to you?
Why didn't you come up?

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:22.691
Done.

00:07:24.235 --> 00:07:27.446
- You just finished?
- Well, I wanted to be thorough.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:33.243
I mean, this is clearly
very, very important to you. To us.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:37.247
And so I wanted to read
every word carefully.

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.457
Twice.

00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:41.710
So, um...

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.296
Does it?

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:51.970
I'm sorry?

00:07:53.681 --> 00:07:59.769
Does it?

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:07.819
Yeah, I wanted to give that whole
"Does it?" part just another glance.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:11.156
What are you talking about, Ross?
You just said that you read it twice.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:14.743
Look, you know what? It either does
or doesn't. And if you have to think...

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:18.497
No, Rach.
No, I don't have to think about it. I don't.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.998
Uh, in fact...

00:08:20.583 --> 00:08:23.752
...I've decided. I have decided...

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.921
...that it...

00:08:31.177 --> 00:08:32.511
...does.

00:08:49.278 --> 00:08:52.197
- Are you sure?
- Oh, sure, I'm sure.

00:08:58.704 --> 00:09:03.583
All right. There's a nuclear holocaust.
I'm the last man on earth.

00:09:04.126 --> 00:09:05.126
Would you go out with me?

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.089
Ehh.

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:12.759
I've got canned goods.

00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:17.389
Hey, you guys, take a look at this.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:20.517
Check this baby out. Dug me a hole.

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:24.813
Excellent hole, Joe.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.525
Oh, no, no. My hole.

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.819
Ow! My foot. Ow!

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.404
What? What is it?

00:09:32.863 --> 00:09:36.074
Jellyfish sting.
Ow, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.285
Well, can we help you,
take you back to the house?

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:39.703
Oh, it's, like, two miles.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:42.205
Yeah, and I'm a little tired
from digging the hole.

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.625
Damn the jellyfish.

00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:48.420
Damn all the jellyfish.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:49.713
We've gotta do something.

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.423
There's only one thing you can do.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.716
What? What is it?

00:09:52.883 --> 00:09:54.217
You're gonna have to pee on it.

00:09:55.803 --> 00:09:58.054
What? Gross.

00:09:58.222 --> 00:10:00.473
Don't blame me.
I saw it on the Discovery Channel.

00:10:00.641 --> 00:10:04.644
You know what? He's right.
There's something like ammonia in that...

00:10:04.812 --> 00:10:06.354
...that kills the pain.

00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:10.358
Well, forget it. It doesn't hurt that bad!

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:13.403
If you want some privacy,
you can use my hole.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:20.452
Well, I'm ready
to get the hell out of here.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:22.537
Oh.

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:23.747
Are you...?

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:25.373
Are you?

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:27.417
Oh, that's so great.

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:28.877
Ooh, not for Bonnie.

00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:32.422
But for you, yay, aah.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.800
- Hey.
- How was the beach?

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:38.219
- Nothing. I don't know.
- Uh, let's not worry about it.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:42.599
- What happened?
- Nothing.

00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.310
- I'm gonna take a shower.
- Me too.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.062
Me too.

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:49.731
Okay, I'm gonna put this in the car.

00:10:49.899 --> 00:10:52.901
Oh, I have to go pack. Oh!

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:55.987
- And it really does?
- It does.

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:58.281
It really and truly does.

00:10:58.449 --> 00:10:59.866
Oh.

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:24.516
It so does not.

00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:31.940
She wants me to take responsibility...

00:11:32.108 --> 00:11:35.068
...for everything that went wrong
in our relationship.

00:11:35.236 --> 00:11:40.323
I mean, she goes on for five pages
about how I was unfaithful to her.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:43.368
We were on a break!

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:47.664
Oh, my God. If you say that one more time,
I'm gonna break up with you.

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:49.499
All right, fine.

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:53.044
But this breakup was not all my fault.
And she says here:

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:56.715
"If you accept full responsibility..."
Full responsibility.

00:11:56.882 --> 00:11:58.842
"...I can begin to trust you again.

00:11:59.009 --> 00:12:02.512
Does that seem like something
you can do? Does it?"

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.558
No?

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:11.187
Look, Ross, you have what you want.
You're back with Rachel.

00:12:11.355 --> 00:12:14.357
You're gonna wreck the best thing
that ever happened to you.

00:12:14.734 --> 00:12:17.819
Yeah, I know. I know, you're right.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.447
Yeah, I guess I'll let it go.

00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:24.033
But you understand how hard it is
to forget about this?

00:12:24.201 --> 00:12:25.744
Sure, it's hard to forget...

00:12:25.911 --> 00:12:29.122
...but that doesn't mean
you have to talk about it.

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:31.332
A lot of things happened on that trip...

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.503
...that we should never, ever talk about.

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:40.216
What the hell happened on that beach?

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.888
It's between us and the sea, Ross.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.066
- Hi, Ursula.
- Hey.

00:12:57.234 --> 00:13:00.320
Okay, well, um, I know that
we haven't talked in a long time.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:03.490
But, um, okay, our mom
is not our birth mom.

00:13:03.657 --> 00:13:05.950
This other lady is our birth mom.

00:13:06.285 --> 00:13:09.245
Right, okay, the one that lives in Montauk.
Mm-hm.

00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:10.789
You know her?

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:14.793
No. I, um... I read about her
in Mom's suicide note.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.253
There was a suicide note?

00:13:17.421 --> 00:13:19.297
Well, do you still have it?

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.883
Hang on.

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:27.305
I can't believe you didn't tell me
there was a suicide note.

00:13:27.473 --> 00:13:29.724
Yeah, so how have you been doing?

00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:32.101
I... Shut up.

00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:39.442
"Goodbye, Phoebe and Ursula.
I'll miss you.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:42.403
P.S. Your mom lives in Montauk."

00:13:43.447 --> 00:13:44.781
You just wrote this.

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:48.952
Well, it's pretty much the gist.

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:53.331
Except for the poem.
You read the poem, right?

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:55.166
No.

00:13:55.918 --> 00:13:57.752
All right. Hang on.

00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:04.884
Pass the cheese, please.

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:08.596
Ugh.

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.725
My God, you can't even look at me,
can you?

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:14.352
No.

00:14:15.855 --> 00:14:18.147
Yay, it's Phoebe. We can talk to Phoebe.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.443
No, I'm too depressed to talk.

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:24.654
I'll give you $1000 to talk to us.

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:27.031
Hey, you guys...

00:14:27.199 --> 00:14:30.118
...what do you think about making
that beach trip an annual thing?

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:32.120
No.

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:34.706
All right, that's it, you guys.
What happened out there?

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:38.251
What? We took a walk.
Nothing happened.

00:14:38.419 --> 00:14:40.461
I came back with nothing all over me.

00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:44.132
- Come on, what happened? Joey?
- What does that mean?

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:46.259
- All right.
- No.

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:48.469
Joey, we swore we'd never tell.

00:14:48.637 --> 00:14:50.805
They'll never understand.

00:14:53.976 --> 00:14:55.643
But we have to say something.

00:14:55.811 --> 00:14:57.770
We have to get it out.
It's eating me alive.

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:04.193
- Monica got stung by a jellyfish.
- All right.

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:08.740
All right.

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:13.870
I got stung.

00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:16.956
Stung bad.

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:20.668
I couldn't stand. I...

00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:22.545
I couldn't walk.

00:15:22.713 --> 00:15:25.131
We were two miles from the house.

00:15:26.675 --> 00:15:28.885
We were scared and alone.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:31.346
We didn't think we could make it.

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:37.852
I was in too much pain.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.271
And I was tired
from digging the huge hole.

00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:45.485
And then Joey remembered something.

00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:48.905
I'd seen this thing
on the Discovery Channel.

00:15:49.073 --> 00:15:50.657
Wait a minute, I saw that.

00:15:50.824 --> 00:15:55.370
On the Discovery Channel.
Yeah, about jellyfish and how if you...

00:15:58.207 --> 00:15:59.791
Ew.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:01.501
You peed on yourself?

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:03.503
Ew.

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:07.215
You can't say that. You don't know.

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:09.676
I thought I was gonna pass out
from the pain.

00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:13.888
Anyway, I tried, but I couldn't...

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:15.139
...bend that way.

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:19.394
So...

00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:22.730
Ew.

00:16:25.275 --> 00:16:27.902
That's right. I stepped up.

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:33.074
She's my friend and she needed help.

00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:36.035
If I had to, I'd pee on any one of you.

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:44.252
Only, uh, I couldn't.

00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:49.841
I got the stage fright.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:54.095
I wanted to help,
but there was just too much pressure...

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:56.222
...so I, uh... I turned to Chandler.

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:05.440
Joey kept screaming at me,
"Do it now. Do it. Do it. Do it now."

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:10.111
Sometimes, late at night,
I can still hear the screaming.

00:17:13.032 --> 00:17:16.617
That's because, sometimes, I just do it
through my wall to freak you out.

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:21.956
And fuchsia and mauve

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:26.627
Those are the 66 colors of my bedroom

00:17:27.671 --> 00:17:29.088
Thank you. Thank you.

00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:33.885
Oh, and I invite all of you
to count the colors in your bedroom.

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.263
Except for you. You go away.

00:17:41.185 --> 00:17:43.227
I'll go in a second.

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:45.480
I just want to tell you...

00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:49.442
...that there hasn't been a day
when I didn't regret giving you up.

00:17:49.818 --> 00:17:51.778
Okay, bye.

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:54.614
No, I'm not done.

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:58.242
I just want you to know, the reason
I never looked you up was because...

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.495
...well, I was afraid that you'd react...

00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:04.082
...just, well, like the way
you're reacting now.

00:18:04.249 --> 00:18:07.543
Can't we just, you know, start from here?
Please?

00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:10.671
No.

00:18:14.009 --> 00:18:15.426
Okay.

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:17.678
Sorry.

00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:21.307
But just one last thing.

00:18:22.476 --> 00:18:25.186
You know, you came looking for family.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:28.189
I'm family.

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:30.983
I'm it.

00:18:33.278 --> 00:18:35.613
Well, now I'm done.

00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:42.120
Yeah, but it's not like
we're losing anything, you know?

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:45.331
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:49.919
It's not like we know each other or anything
or that have anything in common.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:55.383
Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's not like
we don't have anything in common.

00:18:56.885 --> 00:18:59.220
I mean, I like, uh, pizza.

00:18:59.555 --> 00:19:01.681
I... I like pizza.

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:03.599
You do?

00:19:03.767 --> 00:19:06.185
Wait, I like, um, the Beatles.

00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:07.854
Oh, my God. So do I!

00:19:08.021 --> 00:19:10.064
I knew it. Wow.

00:19:10.232 --> 00:19:12.108
Wait, wait, wait. Puppies. Cute or ugly?

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:14.318
- Oh, so cute.
- Oh!

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:17.155
- Well? Ha, ha.
- You see?

00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:19.866
But I'm still... I'm mad at you.

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:21.659
I know.

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:24.579
I'm mad at me too.

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:28.583
Well, um, do you want to get
something to eat?

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:30.585
Because I'm kind of hungry.

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:32.545
Hey. Me too.

00:19:32.713 --> 00:19:35.965
All right, stop it. Now you're just
doing it to freak me out.

00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:44.140
Aw, I missed you.

00:19:44.308 --> 00:19:46.392
I missed you too.

00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:52.273
Oh, I was so nervous about that letter.

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:57.278
But the way you
owned up to everything...

00:19:57.446 --> 00:20:02.241
...it just showed me
how much you've grown, you know?

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:05.953
I suppose.

00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:11.209
No. You have, Ross. You have.
You should give yourself credit.

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:14.712
I mean, my mom never thought
this would work out.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.716
Heh. She was all,
"Once a cheater, always a cheater."

00:20:20.969 --> 00:20:23.554
- Mm-hm.
- Oh.

00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:26.641
I just wish we hadn't lost
those four months.

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:32.438
But if time was what you needed
just to gain a little perspective...

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.484
We were on a break!

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:39.946
- Coffeehouse?
- You bet.

00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:44.533
And for the record, it took two people
to break up this relationship.

00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:46.827
Yeah, you and that girl
from the copy place...

00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:49.580
...which yesterday
you took full responsibility for.

00:20:49.748 --> 00:20:52.667
I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for, okay?

00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:54.627
I didn't finish the whole letter.

00:20:54.795 --> 00:20:56.796
- What?
- I fell asleep.

00:20:56.964 --> 00:20:59.173
You fell asleep?

00:20:59.883 --> 00:21:02.927
Yeah, it was 5:30 in the morning.

00:21:03.095 --> 00:21:08.516
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:11.394
Front and back!

00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:14.438
Oh, oh, oh. And by the way.

00:21:14.606 --> 00:21:18.192
"Y-O-U-apostrophe-R-E" means "you are."

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.111
"Y-O-U-R" means "your."

00:21:21.196 --> 00:21:24.323
I can't believe I even thought
of getting back together with you.

00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:26.075
We are so over.

00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:29.245
Fine by me!

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:31.789
Oh, and hey, hey, hey.

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:35.167
Those spelling tips will come in handy
when you're at home on Saturday nights...

00:21:35.335 --> 00:21:36.794
...playing Scrabble with Monica.

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.005
- Hey.
- Sorry.

00:21:39.881 --> 00:21:43.426
I just feel bad about all that sleep you're
gonna miss, wishing you were with me.

00:21:43.593 --> 00:21:46.012
Oh, no, no.
Don't you worry about me falling asleep.

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:48.764
I still have your letter!

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:53.728
And hey, just so you know,
it's not that common.

00:21:53.895 --> 00:21:57.815
It doesn't happen to every guy
and it is a big deal!

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:00.818
I knew it!

00:22:06.074 --> 00:22:07.283
Gin.

00:22:08.368 --> 00:22:10.244
We were playing gin?

00:22:12.456 --> 00:22:15.249
You know, if we were a couple,
we could play this game naked.

00:22:15.417 --> 00:22:18.085
- Ha, ha. Would you stop?
- Okay.

00:22:18.253 --> 00:22:19.754
All right.

00:22:20.339 --> 00:22:23.257
Okay, all right. I think you're great.

00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:26.635
I think you're sweet and you're smart...

00:22:26.803 --> 00:22:27.887
...and I love you.

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:32.683
But you will always be the guy
who peed on me.
