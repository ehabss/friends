WEBVTT

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:04.712
So, now, what is this, now?

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.172
- Googlie Worm.
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.382
And this?

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.967
Glow Pop Jiggly Jam.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.013
Bait is so funny.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:17.016
Hey, um, what's this?

00:00:17.642 --> 00:00:20.227
Oh, a hunk of sandwich from last year.

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:25.566
Oh, Geller's got one hooked.
Oh! Looks like a big one. Oh! Oh!

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:28.944
It's the classic struggle between man...

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:33.198
Someone knocked over a lamp.

00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:38.120
Hey, you know what's gonna be great
about the fishing trip?

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:41.957
When my dad gives me that, "Joey,
what are you doing with your life?" stuff...

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.127
...I can say, "Well, I'm doing a movie
with Charlton Heston, Dad.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:47.254
- What are you doing with your life?"
- Aw.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.762
You don't have to stop having fun
just because I'm here.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:57.639
Kathy didn't cheat on all of you.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.517
Well, except you.

00:01:10.278 --> 00:01:12.404
I don't think you should
leave Chandler alone.

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:14.990
It's only been two days
since he broke up with Kathy.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:16.742
You can go fishing next week.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.953
There's nothing I can do right now.
He's still in his sweatpants.

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:22.039
That's only phase one.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:26.418
You know? I'll be back for phase two.
I would never miss phase two.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.212
What's phase two?

00:01:28.379 --> 00:01:30.506
Getting drunk and going to a strip club.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.260
How does going to a strip club
make him better?

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.471
There are naked ladies there.

00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:41.016
It helps him get to phase three,
picturing yourself with other women.

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:44.019
- There are naked ladies there too.
- Yeah.

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.482
Would you give me one minute, please?

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:42.494
So these will match the jacket
you picked out for me last week?

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:43.954
Mm-hm.

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.914
There we go.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:49.501
There it is.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.128
- Oh, you know what I need?
- Yeah?

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:54.756
- Gloves. Brown leather dress gloves.
- Oh, okay.

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:58.218
Uh, well, let's see. You're about a...
Well, this one is large. Ha, ha.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.470
And, uh, this one...

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:02.890
- Also a large?
- Yeah. Okay.

00:03:03.057 --> 00:03:05.475
- Yeah.
- Two larges coming right up. Ha, ha.

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:10.272
- Rachel, could I have a moment?
- Yes.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.192
I was wondering, my niece, you see,
is in town from London.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.652
- Uh-huh.
- Shropshire, really, but you know.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.988
She's about your age, I'd say.

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:21.825
Anyway, I have tickets for the opera.
Die Fledermaus.

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:24.703
I was wondering if you would
keep her company this evening.

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.330
- Sure. You got it.
- Oh, good.

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:29.291
Count me in. Me, Fledermaus. Great.
I really...

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.213
Oh, yes, of course. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you so very much.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.839
So?

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:39.259
So...

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.475
- Gloves?
- Oh, right. Sorry, I'll be right back.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.977
Actually, you know what? I gotta take off.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.105
But I was curious,
do you have any plans for tonight?

00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.191
No, nothing.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.194
I invested in this nightclub.
Would you like to come?

00:03:57.362 --> 00:03:59.279
Yeah, that would be great.

00:03:59.447 --> 00:04:01.365
You're into hard-core S and M, right?

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.286
- Well, I guess.
- I'm kidding.

00:04:06.454 --> 00:04:08.830
Oh. Ha-ha-ha. Whew.

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:12.334
I'm gonna put you on the VIP list, okay?
Look for me.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.711
- Yeah. Great. You betcha.
- I'll see you tonight.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.880
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:19.716
- I almost forgot the tickets, didn't I?
- What?

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:23.220
For you and Emily. Tonight.
Die Fledermaus.

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:26.515
Oh. Oh, right.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:29.309
I think you'll like it.
It has two of the Three Tenors.

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:31.937
Okay.

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:40.904
I can't believe Kathy did this to me.
I really thought that she was the one.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.448
Well, I'll tell you what.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:46.118
From now on,
I am not getting out of this chair, ever.

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:49.454
Okay? From now on,
this chair is the one.

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:52.457
You know what else is the one?
My sweatpants.

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:56.461
Come on, man,
just take the sweats off, okay?

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.047
Just take them off
and we'll have some fun.

00:05:02.593 --> 00:05:04.511
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:07.222
- Did you catch any big fish?
- Oh, my God, you guys have no idea.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:08.974
- Oh, wow.
- Oh, my God, you stink.

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.434
Oh, are you kidding?

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:13.061
Three days on the lake without a shower.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.273
Plus, I fell into that big tub of worms
at the bait stand.

00:05:18.318 --> 00:05:19.526
Hey, how's he doing?

00:05:19.694 --> 00:05:21.820
He hasn't gotten out of that chair
in two days.

00:05:21.988 --> 00:05:23.405
Ahem. Hey, buddy, how's it going?

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:33.290
You see that?
He just needed his pal to come home.

00:05:33.458 --> 00:05:34.916
I gotta go memorize my lines.

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:37.669
Me and Charlton Heston,
bright and early tomorrow, baby.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:39.463
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:41.798
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:43.717
- Hey.
- Hey, Monica.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:47.220
- Uh-oh. What's the matter?
- Oh...

00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:51.558
Joshua invited me
to this fancy club opening tonight.

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:54.603
But I already told Mr. Waltham...

00:05:54.771 --> 00:05:59.107
...that I would take his niece
to the dumb old opera.

00:05:59.609 --> 00:06:01.735
So, what are you gonna do?

00:06:03.112 --> 00:06:05.405
- I don't know, sweetie.
- No. Help me.

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:08.658
- I can't. I have to work.
- Phoebe?

00:06:08.826 --> 00:06:11.244
I would, but I get my morning sickness
in the evening.

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:15.582
Ooh, no, unless she wants to spend
the night holding my hair back for me.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.628
Ugh. Gosh, you guys, come on. This is...
I have to meet Joshua.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.422
This is my one chance
for him to see the fun Rachel.

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.718
You know, the "Wouldn't it be great
if she were my wife?" Rachel.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.555
Are Joey and Chandler back?

00:06:30.723 --> 00:06:33.892
Oh, Chandler's still in phase one,
and Joey's that thing you smell.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.310
Oh.

00:06:39.565 --> 00:06:44.111
Hi.

00:06:46.322 --> 00:06:47.781
So?

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.201
No.

00:06:51.369 --> 00:06:53.537
Oh, come on.

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.834
- I think she's here.
- No, wait, wait, wait. Ross, please?

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.337
You want me to take some girl
I've never met to the opera...

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.715
...so you can go to a club
and flirt with some guy?

00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:09.261
Hmm. Yeah, that is a toughie.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:11.471
Oh, she's looking down the hall.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.599
She looked right at me.

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:18.478
Oh, wait, you can't see people
through that little hole, can you?

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.690
Hello.

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.692
- Hello?
- Aah!

00:07:24.819 --> 00:07:27.446
Oh, I'll be right there.
Okay, Ross, please. Come on.

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:29.030
I thought we had moved on.

00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:32.534
I thought we'd gotten to a place
where we could be happy for each other.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:33.952
I mean, was that just me?

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:39.749
- All right, I'll do it.
- Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:42.169
- Emily?
- Yes.

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:45.297
- I'm Rachel Green.
- Thank goodness.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:49.801
There has been a teeny change of plans.
It turns out I'm not free tonight, so...

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:52.053
Really? Heh.

00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:56.558
That's lovely. I must have missed your call,
even though I didn't leave the flat all day.

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.977
- Well, no, I...
- No, no, no, that's not rude.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.562
It's in keeping with a trip...

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.691
...where I've already been run down
by one of your wiener carts...

00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:07.527
...and been strip-searched
at John F. Kennedy Airport.

00:08:07.695 --> 00:08:09.279
Apparently, I look like someone...

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:12.782
...who's got a balloon full of cocaine
stuffed up their bum.

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:18.038
I think you look great.

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:21.583
Good night.
It was very nice to meet you all.

00:08:25.046 --> 00:08:26.588
I'll get her.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:29.424
- Please hurry.
- Okay.

00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:32.719
Don't you just love the way they talk?

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.387
"Ooh. Oh."

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:43.271
Oh!

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:45.440
- What?
- It kicked. I think the baby kicked.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:46.900
- Oh, my God.
- Ha, ha.

00:08:47.068 --> 00:08:50.820
Oh, no, wait. Oh. That was the elastic
in my underwear busted.

00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:54.658
Oh, my God. I overslept.

00:08:54.825 --> 00:08:58.328
I was supposed to be on the set
a half an hour ago. I gotta get out of here.

00:08:58.496 --> 00:09:00.830
What? Joey, you can't go like that.
You stink.

00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:03.750
I fell asleep before I could shower.
Now I don't have time.

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:06.419
They're 10 blocks away.
If I run, I can make it.

00:09:06.587 --> 00:09:08.922
Yeah, run 10 blocks.
That'll help the smell.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.634
Hey. Whoa! Slow down.
No, keep moving. Whoa.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.972
- So how did it go with Joshua last night?
- Oh. Well, I didn't see Joshua.

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:20.058
But I did punch a girl in the face.

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.268
- What?
- Why?

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:23.853
The whole night was horrible.
It was pouring rain.

00:09:24.021 --> 00:09:28.984
And there was no Rachel Green on the list,
but there was a Rachel Greep.

00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:30.944
Oh. So did you get to meet her?

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:37.659
No, there is no Rachel Greep.
But then this other girl overheard us.

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:41.371
And she was all, "I'm Rachel Greep,
I'm Rachel Greep," and he let her in.

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:43.999
- So you hit her in the face?
- No, she was already in.

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:47.502
But then this big bitch behind me
tried to steal my umbrella...

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.753
...so I clocked her.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.090
Ugh. I can't believe this.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:56.678
All I wanted was just a few hours
outside of work to see Joshua...

00:09:56.846 --> 00:10:00.348
...so that he could go ahead
and start falling in love with me.

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:05.186
Aw. Pheebs.

00:10:06.814 --> 00:10:07.981
Honey, that's your name.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:13.570
That's short for Phoebe?
I thought that's what we called each other.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:19.409
- Hey, you're wearing pants.
- That's right.

00:10:19.577 --> 00:10:22.454
Where are the guys?
I'm ready to get drunk and see strippers.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:27.334
- It's 9:30 in the morning.
- They got a breakfast buffet.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.547
- Hello? Oh, hey, Ross.
- Ooh. Let me talk to him.

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:33.757
Oh, my God.

00:10:33.924 --> 00:10:35.258
- Can't I just...?
- Shh. Wait, what?

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.761
- It's my phone and she's shush...
- Shh. Please.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:39.346
What's he saying?

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.098
He's with Emily at a bed and breakfast
in Vermont.

00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:44.184
What? Oh, my God.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:47.729
Who the hell is Emily? No.

00:10:50.441 --> 00:10:52.233
They're in Vermont?
How did this happen?

00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:53.818
Ow.

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.364
How did he end up in Vermont
with that awful witch?

00:10:57.907 --> 00:10:59.908
Maybe she doesn't hit him all the time.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:02.744
When we met her...

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:04.913
...she was soaking, her feet were wet.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:06.665
Who wouldn't be miserable?

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:11.127
Once I got her into a dry pair of shoes,
she was a totally different person.

00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:14.923
Ross, come quickly. There's a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard.

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:18.927
I gotta go! There's a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard!

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:25.308
He had to go. There was a deer outside
eating fruit from the orchard.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:29.104
I don't get this. She was horrible.

00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:31.314
Okay, I'm gonna go stand over there.

00:11:33.109 --> 00:11:36.695
- Why do you care so much, anyway?
- I don't care.

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:41.741
You know what? I'm just upset
that I'm getting nowhere with Joshua.

00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:46.162
Know what? Still, you do not just meet
someone and go flitting off to Vermont.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.374
Well, when you first met Barry,
you flitted off to Vail.

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:54.504
Ugh. You know, could you just for once
not remember every little thing?

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.968
So, you know, when's he getting back?

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:01.636
- A couple of days.
- Know what?

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:03.972
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.224
What are you doing?

00:12:06.684 --> 00:12:09.644
Chandler. You can't just go back a phase.

00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:13.273
Yes, you can. You're thinking about time.
You can't go back in time.

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:19.696
Why don't you just...? Why don't you do
your phase-two strip-club thing with us?

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:23.158
- Yeah, come on, we can be guys.
- Heh. No, you can't.

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.995
Come on, let us be guys.
Maybe we wanna be guys.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.288
You don't wanna be guys.

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:31.207
You'd be all hairy
and you wouldn't live as long.

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:32.667
You know, you...

00:12:32.835 --> 00:12:36.588
Would you just stop being such a wuss
and get those off?

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:39.716
And you come with us
and watch naked girls dance around.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.011
Okay.

00:12:44.388 --> 00:12:46.181
I'm sorry.

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:53.021
Hey, Joey Tribbiani. I'm here, I'm here.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.190
Calm down, we got time.
We're running a little late.

00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:56.399
Oh.

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:00.069
All set.

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:07.035
Look at that.
Charlton Heston eating a licorice whip.

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:10.246
Yeah, he loves them.
I've never seen him with...

00:13:13.751 --> 00:13:18.713
Whoa. Yeah. What the hell is that?
What smells so bad?

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.840
- You.
- Oh.

00:13:21.008 --> 00:13:25.887
I could see why you would think that.
But actually, you know who I think it is?

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:29.891
- You?
- No, no. It's Heston.

00:13:32.478 --> 00:13:34.562
- What?
- The man reeks.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.982
Smells like he went on a three-day
fishing trip and then ate licorice. Ick.

00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:39.859
There's no way he smells.

00:13:40.027 --> 00:13:43.154
He's the only one around here
with a shower in his dressing room.

00:13:43.322 --> 00:13:47.325
Really? A shower, huh?
And, uh, which room might that be?

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.745
The one with "Heston" on it.

00:13:51.705 --> 00:13:53.832
Interesting.

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.842
Gonna take my time

00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:10.348
Hey. I got some ones.
You wanna put them in her panties?

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.934
No, thanks, Mom.

00:14:14.854 --> 00:14:17.689
Oh. No. Um, hi. That, that.

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.608
You have to put that out
because I'm pregnant, so...

00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:24.529
Well, maybe you and your baby
ought to go to another strip club.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:27.740
Heh, heh. It's not my baby. Heh, heh.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.454
Very good. Yes. That was so good.

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:38.042
Really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.963
Well, I just checked our messages,
and Joshua didn't call.

00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:45.550
I mean, you would think he'd be worried
about me not showing up.

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:50.513
Ugh. And you know what makes it worse?
Ross is all happy in Vermont.

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:53.641
Come on, look where you are.

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:58.938
- Another round of daiquiris.
- Remember, virgin for me, please.

00:14:59.106 --> 00:15:02.400
Oh, and don't let me leave
without getting the name of that carpet guy.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.193
Oh, come on.

00:15:04.987 --> 00:15:07.488
You know what?
I'm just gonna go home and call Kathy.

00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:10.825
- Well, if you think it'll help.
- No. That was a test.

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:13.953
In a couple hours, I'm gonna get drunk
and wanna call Kathy...

00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:15.371
...and you have to stop me.

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:18.416
Then I'm gonna be so drunk,
I'm gonna wanna call Janice.

00:15:18.584 --> 00:15:20.335
- You should. How is she?
- Oh!

00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:24.714
I think somebody
needs another lap dance.

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:44.984
Hello? Who's in there?

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:51.616
How you doing?

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:54.577
Who in the hell are you?

00:15:54.745 --> 00:15:58.247
Uh, guess you wouldn't believe me
if I said I was Kirk Douglas, huh?

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:03.211
Put some pants on, kid,
so I can kick your butt.

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:06.297
No, no, no, wait. You don't understand.

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:09.300
See, I'm an actor.

00:16:10.469 --> 00:16:13.388
Joey Tribbiani.
I'm doing a scene with you today.

00:16:13.555 --> 00:16:14.764
And, well, I stink.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:17.976
- You're in this picture?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:16:18.143 --> 00:16:21.771
I'm one of the cops who won't work
with you because you're a loose cannon.

00:16:21.939 --> 00:16:24.899
Anyway, look, I'm really sorry, but I just...
I stink.

00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:29.404
- Joey, right?
- Yeah.

00:16:32.533 --> 00:16:36.035
Every actor, one time or another... Ah.

00:16:38.622 --> 00:16:40.540
Every actor thinks he stinks.

00:16:40.708 --> 00:16:44.252
Even Laurence Olivier
sometimes thought he stank.

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.214
- Bob Redford won't even watch himself.
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

00:16:48.382 --> 00:16:50.758
- Listen to me.
- No... Yeah.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.553
I don't know one actor worth his salt...

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:58.349
...who one time in his career didn't say,
"God, I stink."

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:03.104
Hell, I just did a scene out there.
First take, I stunk the place up.

00:17:04.314 --> 00:17:08.693
But the important thing
that you must remember...

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:11.821
...no matter how badly
you think you stink...

00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:17.618
...you must never, ever bust into
my dressing room and use my shower.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.787
Do you understand me?

00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:22.999
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'm very sorry.
- Wait a minute.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:25.960
- Take your pants.
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:32.300
- So we did okay at the strip club, right?
- Oh, yeah. That was great.

00:17:32.468 --> 00:17:35.053
Thanks to you,
the hottest waitress there is quitting...

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.221
...to teach the third grade.

00:17:38.098 --> 00:17:40.099
I can't believe it. He still hasn't called.

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:42.477
- Who, Josh?
- It's "Joshua."

00:17:42.644 --> 00:17:45.146
- What, he doesn't like "Josh"?
- No, I don't.

00:17:46.523 --> 00:17:48.816
All right.
Well, I'm gonna put my sweats back on.

00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:50.985
No, wait. You know what?
You were right.

00:17:51.153 --> 00:17:54.072
We really weren't great at being guys.
But do you know why?

00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:56.616
Because we're girls.

00:17:57.409 --> 00:17:59.786
- Yeah.
- Do you know what girls are good at?

00:17:59.953 --> 00:18:01.204
Stripping.

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:06.334
No, listening. Sit.

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:11.339
You know, maybe it would really,
really help if you would just talk.

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:14.509
Yeah, come on.
What's going on in there?

00:18:16.178 --> 00:18:17.178
Yeah.

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:20.848
And you know, if you wanna cry,
that's okay too.

00:18:21.767 --> 00:18:24.519
Okay, look,
I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave.

00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:26.104
Come on, Chandler.

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:30.525
Look, forget it.
We tried, but phase three is a lost cause.

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:32.360
Those strippers were insanely hot...

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:35.404
...and I couldn't picture myself
with any of them.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:41.619
- They really were pretty, weren't they?
- Oh.

00:18:41.787 --> 00:18:44.330
- I really liked that fighter pilot one.
- Oh, Candy?

00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:48.126
- Oh, she was so spunky.
- Yeah.

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:51.254
You know,
I think if I were gonna be with a woman...

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.591
...it'd be with someone like Michelle.

00:18:55.759 --> 00:18:58.803
She was... Oh, she was just so petite.

00:18:58.971 --> 00:19:01.514
See, I don't know.
For me, it would have to be Chantal.

00:19:01.682 --> 00:19:03.015
- Oh, Chantal, yeah.
- Chantal.

00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:05.560
You know? Oh, my God. The... Oh.

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:07.186
She had the smoothest skin.

00:19:07.354 --> 00:19:11.691
I mean, when I stuck that dollar bill
in her G-string and grazed her thigh...

00:19:11.859 --> 00:19:13.818
Phase three!

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:15.736
I just achieved phase three!

00:19:16.071 --> 00:19:17.071
Really?

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.740
I am totally picturing you
with all those women.

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:25.288
- That's not phase three.
- Well, I'm there too.

00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:30.793
- Well, are we all together in a group?
- Stop it, you're killing me.

00:19:30.961 --> 00:19:32.879
I think I just moved on to phase four.

00:19:33.046 --> 00:19:35.923
- Oh, what is that?
- Where I don't want a relationship ever.

00:19:36.091 --> 00:19:39.594
I just wanna have sex with strippers
and my friends.

00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:46.893
Come on. Let me see that smile.

00:19:47.102 --> 00:19:48.227
I don't wanna.

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:50.021
Please?

00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:53.107
I wanted to go to the strip club.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.776
You're gonna have plenty of chances,
okay?

00:19:55.944 --> 00:19:59.947
There are thousands of women out there
who are just waiting to screw me over.

00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:03.117
Yeah, all right.

00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:05.119
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:20:05.287 --> 00:20:07.580
Hey. Ooh, how was Vermont?

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:10.708
Emily is incredible.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.336
I mean,
there are no words to describe her.

00:20:13.503 --> 00:20:17.423
The whole weekend was like a dream.

00:20:18.258 --> 00:20:21.010
- Oh. And you. Rach. Hey.
- Oh, hey.

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:24.680
- You were so right.
- What?

00:20:24.848 --> 00:20:27.642
What you said about us
finally being in a place...

00:20:27.809 --> 00:20:29.769
...where we could really be happy
for each other.

00:20:29.937 --> 00:20:32.188
- Hmm.
- I mean, I...

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:35.775
- I admit, I wasn't quite there.
- Mm-hm.

00:20:35.943 --> 00:20:39.070
You know, I mean,
the thought of you and that Josh guy...

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:43.074
- "Joshua."
- Joshua guy at that club...

00:20:43.242 --> 00:20:45.409
...dancing, having a good time.

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:47.328
And the thought of it kind of...

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:49.538
- You know?
- Yeah.

00:20:49.706 --> 00:20:53.459
But now, but now, I'm totally there.

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:55.878
I'm finally where you are.

00:20:56.046 --> 00:20:57.797
Oh, thank goodness.

00:20:57.965 --> 00:21:01.008
Yeah, and thank you for Emily.

00:21:01.176 --> 00:21:04.845
Oh, no problem.
I'm so glad I could help, you know?

00:21:05.013 --> 00:21:06.889
I'm happy for you.

00:21:07.057 --> 00:21:08.182
Happy for you.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.686
Oh, no, happy for you.

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:18.609
All right, ladies,
here's what we're gonna do.

00:21:18.777 --> 00:21:21.279
You are gonna take off my clothes.

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:23.614
You two go get the oils.

00:21:23.782 --> 00:21:26.117
And you constantly scream
at the top of your voice:

00:21:26.285 --> 00:21:28.661
"Chandler's the king!
Chandler's the king!"

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:31.247
No, I wanna be with her. I like her.

00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:34.542
Oh, that's fine. Go with your instincts.
Go with your instincts.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.043
Wait, what am I doing again?

00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:39.088
Would you please pay attention?
I could wake up at any moment.

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:41.757
Hi, I'm Joshua.
I'm here to pick up Rachel.

00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:43.759
No, no, no, that's not Joshua.

00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:47.054
What do you want from me?
I never met the guy.

00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:53.352
So anyway, Rachel, I'm sorry you can't stay.
The rest of us have a lot of work to do.

00:21:57.024 --> 00:21:58.691
What are you doing?

00:21:59.568 --> 00:22:01.736
All right, listen, I gotta wake up.
