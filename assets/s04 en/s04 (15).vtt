WEBVTT

00:00:02.711 --> 00:00:04.712
I'm can't believe
I'm getting my nails done.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.423
And you said it was gonna be fun.

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.800
Which it kind of is.

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:14.179
You said there were gonna be other guys.
There are no other guys.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:18.851
- Chandler, there's a guy right over there.
- That's a mailman.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.186
That's our mailman.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.772
Hi, how are you?

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:32.031
Chandler, don't worry.
This doesn't make you any less of a guy.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:34.033
That does.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.703
What am I sitting on?

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:43.375
Heh. I'd hate to think what this woman
was scratching when this broke off.

00:00:43.793 --> 00:00:45.961
- Know who used to have nails like that?
- No.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.049
Oh, my God.

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:45.813
Joey, let me ask you a question.
This has been driving me crazy.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.315
- What does this light switch do?
- Oh, nothing.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:51.443
Didn't it drive you crazy
to not know what it did?

00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:53.654
I know what it did. Nothing.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:58.033
They wouldn't have put it there
if it didn't do something.

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.994
- How can you not care?
- Like this:

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.833
Well, here's another question for you.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.752
Do you know what that little silver knob
on the toilet does?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.088
- Sure. It flushes it.
- Okay, good.

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:15.759
Now, since you know, when you come over,
would you mind actually using it?

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:19.763
- Hello.
- Hey. Aah!

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.852
- Oh, my God. Wow.
- Guess who we ran into today?

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:29.690
- Janice.
- Is this amazing?

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:33.026
- How have you been?
- Well, um, I'm divorced.

00:02:33.862 --> 00:02:35.028
- Wow.
- Really?

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:37.489
Yeah, I'm riding the alimony pony.

00:02:40.243 --> 00:02:41.994
And there it is.

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.914
I just came up to say hi. Hi.

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:49.418
- You, sweetie, I'll see you later.
- Okay.

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:51.128
Mwah. I'll see you tonight.

00:02:51.296 --> 00:02:52.754
- Bye. Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:55.340
- Bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye.
- Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Oh.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.134
I can't stand the woman.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:01.972
What?
I thought you were crazy about her.

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.517
You know all those little annoying things
she did before we fell in love?

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:08.979
You know, like her voice and her laugh
and her personality?

00:03:09.147 --> 00:03:11.690
Well, they're all back, you know.

00:03:11.858 --> 00:03:14.610
And she's picked up like nine new ones.

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:17.821
So, what are you doing bringing her here?
There's people here.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.284
Don't worry about it.
I'm taking care of it tonight.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:25.579
You are not. You have never been able
to break up with her.

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.623
Well, I don't have to break up with her.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.459
We're not involved.
I'm gonna do a preemptive strike.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:33.587
I'm gonna end it with her before it starts.

00:03:33.755 --> 00:03:36.256
My ass is, like, frozen.

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:40.469
Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer
for 20 minutes.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.390
I'm telling you.

00:03:52.815 --> 00:03:55.525
I can't believe
you really walk alone here at night.

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:58.153
I mean,
you hear such stories about New York.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.113
No, it's really not that bad.

00:04:00.281 --> 00:04:02.366
I mean, I, for one, feel perfectly safe.

00:04:04.786 --> 00:04:08.288
Help! Help! Help!

00:04:08.456 --> 00:04:11.833
No, no, no, Ross.
Ross, these are friends of mine from home.

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:15.003
- Liam, Devon, this is Ross.
- Oh. Heh.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.213
- Hi, mate.
- Hey.

00:04:16.381 --> 00:04:17.631
- How are you, man?
- Ha, ha.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:21.343
That was a good one, huh?
I was like, "Help! Help!"

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.011
So how are you?

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.639
I've been meaning to ring you
ever since I arrived...

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.350
...but, um, well, I've been rather busy.

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:31.979
You realize we have not seen each other
since the night of that U2 concert?

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.356
- Ah.
- Oh, my God, I think you're right.

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.943
Well, actually, the last time you and I
saw each other was the next morning.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.320
Ha, ha. Oh, Liam.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:43.490
Heh. Oh, Liam.

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:47.160
So, what, were you guys playing soccer
or something?

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:48.578
Or should I call it...

00:04:48.746 --> 00:04:50.664
..."football"? Uh...

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:53.250
We were playing rugby.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:56.795
In fact, we're playing a game tomorrow.
You're welcome to play too.

00:04:56.963 --> 00:05:00.173
Ha, ha. Ross play rugby? I don't think so.

00:05:00.341 --> 00:05:02.384
Heh. What?

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:04.011
What's so funny about that?

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:07.055
Well, I mean, you're American,
to start with.

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.057
You don't really have rugby here.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:14.646
Heh. Well, we didn't have freedom here
until 1776 either, so...

00:05:14.814 --> 00:05:17.566
So good, then.
We'll see you at Riverside Park at 2.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.110
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.247
Oh, boy. I just love to sing.

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.790
Yes, I know that you do.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:36.043
One of the reasons
people were complaining...

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.297
...was because most of the people had paid
to hear the actor sing "Old Man River."

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:42.132
Oh, look at us.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.053
Who would've thought that Cupid
had a station at 14th Street Nails?

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.349
Okay, we have to talk.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:55.562
I'm just getting out
of a very serious relationship.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.607
I know.
And I'm just getting out of a marriage.

00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.818
I mean, talk about meant to be.

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:06.323
Right. But I just think
this is happening too soon.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:09.659
Oh, too soon, too schmoon.

00:06:09.827 --> 00:06:13.288
Face it, honey,
I am not letting you get away this time.

00:06:14.123 --> 00:06:16.249
- I hear you.
- Ha, ha.

00:06:19.128 --> 00:06:23.298
But unfortunately, my company...

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:25.967
...is transferring me overseas.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.888
Oh, no.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:32.140
Where to?

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.685
- To Paris?
- No. No, not Paris.

00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:39.773
To London? Oh. No, Rome?
Vienna? Ooh, ooh. Barcelona?

00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:42.818
Okay, could you just stop talking
for a second?

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:46.321
Yemen.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.536
That's right. Yes.
I'm being transferred to Yemen.

00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:55.789
- When?
- I don't know exactly.

00:06:57.166 --> 00:07:02.754
Well, I will just have to soak up
every ounce of Chandler Bing...

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:06.174
...until that moment comes.

00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:10.137
But I do know it's sometime tomorrow.

00:07:14.684 --> 00:07:16.143
- Done?
- Yep.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:17.936
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.354
What's up?

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:21.523
This switch thing
has been driving me crazy.

00:07:21.691 --> 00:07:24.025
So I turned it off
and checked every outlet.

00:07:24.193 --> 00:07:28.280
Now, four don't work, which means one
of them has to be controlled by the switch.

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:32.033
So I plugged in things in all four outlets
that make noise.

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:34.744
That way, when I turn it on,
I just follow the noise...

00:07:34.912 --> 00:07:36.746
...and find out which one it is.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:40.292
I bet I stopped listening before you did.

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.212
You know,
you also could have used lamps...

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:45.881
...and then followed the light.

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:50.844
Yeah, well, I'm using noise. Okay?

00:07:51.012 --> 00:07:52.471
All right, so everybody ready?

00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:55.223
Here we go.

00:07:57.685 --> 00:08:01.396
There's something.
I hear something. Where is it?

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.742
It's coming from Joey.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.663
Oh, my God. That's so freaky.
Turn him off.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:25.545
With the set scrum in center field.

00:08:26.255 --> 00:08:27.547
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

00:08:27.715 --> 00:08:31.134
Could we put on the news?
I think it might be raining.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:35.430
No, just hold on a sec.
I'm watching this rugby thing on ESPN.

00:08:35.598 --> 00:08:38.850
I don't know what the big deal is.
I'm man enough to play this sport.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:43.021
Dude, you're not even man enough
to order the channel that carries the sport.

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:46.608
Hey there, Ross.

00:08:47.443 --> 00:08:48.944
Hey.

00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:50.612
Janice.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:56.243
You know, uh,
you really didn't have to help me pack.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:08:58.411
Oh. When you said
all you were gonna be doing...

00:08:58.579 --> 00:09:00.914
...between now and the time you leave
is packing...

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.291
...you really didn't leave me much choice.

00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:06.127
Well, I thought I did,
but I guess I did not.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:10.966
- Hey. What's going on?
- Oh, I'm packing.

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:14.427
You know, I'm packing
because I'm moving to Yemen tomorrow.

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:16.930
Thanks for telling me.

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:23.478
I'm only pretend-moving to Yemen, okay?
It's the only way I can get rid of her.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.855
Oh. Good one.

00:09:27.441 --> 00:09:30.735
And Yemen.
That actually sounds like a real country.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:32.988
Hey, Chandler, come on.

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:36.491
I'm gonna show you how to roll
your underwear and stuff it in your shoes.

00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:40.704
- It's a real space-saver.
- I do that because it makes me look taller.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.041
Hey, Chandler. Come on.

00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:46.293
Okay.

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.087
- Joey, trade lives with me.
- Nope.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.842
Man, look at this.
Ross, I can't believe you said you'd play.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.803
- Look how brutal this is.
- Hey, I can handle it, all right?

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:58.096
Oh, please, Ross.

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:02.309
You got hurt playing badminton
with my dad.

00:10:02.476 --> 00:10:06.062
That's because your mom's dog
kept looking at me.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:11.192
Okay, Ross, look, look, look.
Right here, it's called a "scrum," okay?

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.322
- It's kind of like a huddle.
- And is a hum kind of like a scruddle?

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:19.159
Ross, they're gonna kill you.

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.912
Why are you doing this, anyway?

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.625
Well, you should've seen the guy
that she used to go out with.

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:28.960
I mean, he's like Joe Rugby.

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:32.339
You're kidding. And he plays rugby?
That's so funny.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.509
Oh, I see. You did that. All right.

00:10:38.387 --> 00:10:42.557
Anyway, she thought the very idea of me
playing rugby with him was, like, hilarious.

00:10:42.725 --> 00:10:45.268
So I'm gonna show her
how tough I really am.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.191
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You're right.
You are a tough guy.

00:10:51.359 --> 00:10:53.568
You're the toughest paleontologist
I know.

00:10:54.236 --> 00:10:55.236
All right, come on.

00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:58.740
Look, Ross can take care of himself.
It's not like he's Chandler.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:00.575
Thanks.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:02.702
Look, don't worry about me.

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:06.414
I'll just look real energetic
and stay away from the ball.

00:11:06.582 --> 00:11:08.750
I'll be that guy, right outside the circle.

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:11.711
- Ooh.
- Oh!

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.214
Oh, jeez.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.093
Oh. Well, maybe there was a dog
looking at him.

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:28.103
Okay, Ross, Ross, Ross.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.606
You're gonna wanna stay away
from that guy and that guy and that one.

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:34.234
Dude, they're all huge.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.778
They don't look any bigger than me.

00:11:36.946 --> 00:11:38.780
That's because you're closer to you.

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.990
So you look bigger to you
from where you are.

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:45.036
I'm just gonna go and say hello
to the lads.

00:11:45.204 --> 00:11:46.955
- All right.
- Okay.

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:51.376
Hi.

00:11:51.544 --> 00:11:52.669
Oh.

00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:56.005
I kind of liked it.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:01.094
Okay, I know what I've gotta do.
I've gotta go Red Ross.

00:12:02.847 --> 00:12:05.473
You know, Red Ross?

00:12:05.641 --> 00:12:07.684
Totally don't know
what you're talking about.

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:10.979
That time that we were all waiting in line
for Dances With Wolves...

00:12:11.147 --> 00:12:14.315
...and that one guy cut in front of us,
and I just lost it?

00:12:14.483 --> 00:12:17.777
Huh? Screamed at him, turned all red.

00:12:17.945 --> 00:12:19.404
Red Ross!

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.073
No.

00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:24.492
You'll see.

00:12:25.536 --> 00:12:27.328
Liam, do me a favor.

00:12:27.496 --> 00:12:30.665
Tell the lads to go easy on Ross.
It's his first time.

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:32.584
You don't say?

00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:41.092
- Thanks.
- Okay.

00:12:41.969 --> 00:12:43.845
Good luck, babe.

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:46.389
Ross. Ross, come on, get in here.

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.351
Ross, come on.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:57.525
Ross.

00:12:57.693 --> 00:12:59.778
Ross, come on, get in the bloody scrum.

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.197
Ross, get in.

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:15.460
Joey!

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:21.925
Oh. You are not gonna believe it.
Joshua came in today, and guess what.

00:13:22.092 --> 00:13:23.551
- He asked you out?
- No.

00:13:23.719 --> 00:13:27.639
But I was showing him some cuff links,
and I felt his pulse.

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:31.518
Saucy.

00:13:32.436 --> 00:13:36.231
- What are these?
- Oh. Electrical plans for the building.

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:40.109
Okay, okay, okay, should I be scared?

00:13:40.277 --> 00:13:44.239
I know that switch has gotta do something.
So I went to City Hall and I got these.

00:13:44.406 --> 00:13:47.200
All I had to do was pay $25
and wait in line for three hours.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.829
Wow. If only more people knew.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.678
You know, you really didn't have to take me
to the airport.

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.931
Oh, please. Every moment is precious.

00:14:10.099 --> 00:14:13.226
Besides, somebody had to ride
in that other taxi with your luggage.

00:14:13.394 --> 00:14:16.563
And your friends don't seem to care
very much that you're leaving.

00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:19.065
Well, we're not really that close.

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:24.279
Okay. So I guess this is, uh,
you know, goodbye, then.

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:25.822
Oh, no, no.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:28.992
It's not goodbye.
I'm not leaving until you get on that plane.

00:14:30.286 --> 00:14:33.705
Okay, well,
I guess it's just "wait here," then.

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:39.085
Hi. I need a fake ticket to Yemen.

00:14:40.337 --> 00:14:42.755
- One ticket to Yemen?
- Oh, no, no, no.

00:14:42.923 --> 00:14:45.466
I just need a pretend ticket.

00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:47.677
I'm sorry, sir, I don't understand.

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:50.847
What would you give to a kid
if he wanted a ticket to play with?

00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:53.516
Are you traveling with a child?

00:14:54.768 --> 00:14:56.436
No.

00:14:57.688 --> 00:15:00.773
Oh. She's gonna think
that I'm handing you a credit card.

00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:04.736
But what I'm really gonna do
is hand you a library card.

00:15:05.195 --> 00:15:10.867
Uh, sir, a ticket to Yemen is $2100,
and we don't take library cards.

00:15:11.493 --> 00:15:13.870
What's the matter? Is something wrong?

00:15:14.496 --> 00:15:16.039
Do you have to stay?

00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:19.709
American Express?

00:15:23.797 --> 00:15:25.882
Ross!

00:15:29.136 --> 00:15:30.178
- Oh.
- Ah.

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:33.723
I can't believe they're doing that to him.
I told them to go easy on him.

00:15:33.891 --> 00:15:36.351
No offense, but sometimes it's hard
to understand you...

00:15:36.518 --> 00:15:38.436
...you know, with the accent, so...

00:15:40.147 --> 00:15:42.440
- That's just halftime. There's more of this.
- Oh.

00:15:42.608 --> 00:15:43.650
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:45.193
Hey.

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:49.989
Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh?
That is one fun game.

00:15:50.157 --> 00:15:52.951
- Right.
- Do me a favor? Grab me a bottle of water?

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:54.869
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

00:15:56.664 --> 00:15:59.832
- I think I'm dying. I really do.
- Oh, poor baby.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.793
Tell my son that I love him.

00:16:03.253 --> 00:16:06.589
Oh, excellent.
Okay, gotta have some more fun.

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:08.508
Ross, they are killing you out there.

00:16:10.344 --> 00:16:13.262
- That's not true.
- She's right. You have to stop.

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:16.599
What? No. No, I'm not stopping.
I'm Red Ross.

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:19.978
Dude, you go back out there,
you're gonna be Dead Ross.

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:23.398
I don't care. I am not quitting.
I am gonna finish this game.

00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:26.567
All right. If you insist on doing this,
at least let me help you.

00:16:26.735 --> 00:16:30.780
God, no. That is no place for a woman.
Those guys will grab anything.

00:16:31.907 --> 00:16:33.241
That's not what I was saying.

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:36.619
I just might know a few things
that could help you inflict some pain.

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:40.164
- I like that.
- Yeah? Listen closely.

00:16:40.332 --> 00:16:42.417
- Devon has got a weak ankle.
- Huh?

00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:44.669
One swift kick and he'll back off.

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:46.587
All right, bad ankle. Got it.

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:48.673
- And that big bloke with the beard?
- Uh-huh.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:50.591
- He's got a trick hip.
- Ha, ha.

00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:54.637
Yeah. And David over there,
I heard that he doesn't wear a cup.

00:16:54.805 --> 00:16:58.057
Real...? I could use that.
Trick hip, no cup. Okay, okay.

00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:00.810
And Liam. Liam's got bad knees.

00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:03.187
You hit him right
and he'll go down like a lamp.

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:05.064
But Liam's on my team.

00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:08.276
- I don't care. You just get him.
- Go get him.

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:11.487
Okay. I am going back in.

00:17:13.991 --> 00:17:17.326
Red Ross. Yeah.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.123
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:27.587
What are these?

00:17:27.755 --> 00:17:31.132
Oh, just some pictures I made
and hung up.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.510
I thought they'd brighten up the place.
They do, don't you think?

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.182
- Aah!
- No, no, don't, don't.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:41.350
Oh!

00:17:43.353 --> 00:17:46.647
I know that there's no hole there.
I just really like that picture.

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:51.694
Oh, my God. Look at this.

00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:55.323
But there is a wire back there.
That switch is connected to something.

00:17:55.491 --> 00:17:59.410
I don't care.
The wires have come loose in your head.

00:17:59.828 --> 00:18:02.914
I thought if I could follow the wire,
I could find out what it did.

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:06.000
- And did you?
- No.

00:18:06.502 --> 00:18:08.544
It disappears
back behind that baseboard.

00:18:09.004 --> 00:18:11.672
For a minute there,
I thought it went downstairs.

00:18:16.386 --> 00:18:18.179
But it didn't.

00:18:19.515 --> 00:18:22.767
- Say hello to Mrs. Catrokis.
- Oh, my God.

00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:26.813
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Mrs. Catrokis.

00:18:31.443 --> 00:18:33.611
Are you sure
you don't wanna go see a doctor?

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.948
Oh, no, that'll just bring me down.

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:41.244
This was great. I mean, I was great.
This was a great day.

00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:43.871
You know what?
I'm buying everyone coffee.

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:46.165
Someone just grab my wallet.
It's in my pocket.

00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:47.500
- Yeah, sure.
- No, not you.

00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:49.127
Okay.

00:18:49.586 --> 00:18:52.880
Look, your eye's still popping out a little.
I'm gonna go get some ice.

00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:55.633
- Okay.
- Ooh, ice, yeah. I'm so in the mood for ice.

00:18:58.053 --> 00:19:00.596
- You were amazing out there.
- Oh.

00:19:00.764 --> 00:19:03.474
- I kind of was, wasn't I?
- Oh, my God.

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:07.812
I made a man twice my size cry.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:12.859
I mean, I haven't done that since I was 4
and I washed my dad's Porsche with rocks.

00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:16.821
You really enjoyed yourself, didn't you?

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.740
Please, are you kidding?
I hurt three huge men.

00:19:19.908 --> 00:19:21.742
I gave a guy a bloody nose.

00:19:21.910 --> 00:19:24.495
I mean, I'm not proud of it...

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.497
...but I really am.

00:19:27.916 --> 00:19:29.917
And it's all because of you.

00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:34.839
- Yeah. Wonderful, amazing you.
- I think you've got a concussion.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.592
No, no, I'm serious. Thank you.

00:19:38.802 --> 00:19:40.803
You're welcome.

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:46.142
- I'm sorry. Did that hurt you?
- It's worth the pain.

00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:50.021
You know what?
You know what? It's not.

00:19:55.527 --> 00:19:59.780
This is the final
boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.

00:20:02.743 --> 00:20:04.452
Well, I guess I gotta go.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:07.580
Oh. My Bing-a-ling.

00:20:09.583 --> 00:20:10.833
I'll wait for you.

00:20:11.001 --> 00:20:13.127
Do you even know
how long you're gonna be gone?

00:20:14.129 --> 00:20:19.508
Well, just until we find an energy source
to replace fuel.

00:20:19.927 --> 00:20:23.846
Oh. Well, I'll write you every day.

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:27.141
15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

00:20:28.852 --> 00:20:31.062
Okay. Goodbye.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.813
Goodbye.

00:20:46.286 --> 00:20:47.328
- Chandler?
- No.

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:49.288
Chandler.

00:20:49.456 --> 00:20:52.667
Janice. There you are. There you are.
I had to have one last kiss.

00:20:52.834 --> 00:20:56.504
And also, also, you said you were
gonna leave right after I got on the plane.

00:20:57.297 --> 00:21:00.883
No. No. I wanna see you take off.

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:04.053
Well, then I guess I'm going to Yemen.

00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:08.182
I'm going to Yemen.

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:12.895
When we get to Yemen,
can I stay with you?

00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:22.947
All right.
The super couldn't figure out what it did.

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:27.159
The $200-an-hour electrician
couldn't figure out what it did.

00:21:27.327 --> 00:21:30.538
I've had seven pretty serious shocks.

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:34.417
- I officially give up.
- Thank God.

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:37.378
I guess Joey was right.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.839
It does nothing.

00:21:44.761 --> 00:21:46.304
See?

00:21:50.225 --> 00:21:54.061
I'm doing it. I am totally doing it.

00:22:00.902 --> 00:22:02.737
I lost it.
