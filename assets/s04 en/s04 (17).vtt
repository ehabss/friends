WEBVTT

00:00:06.881 --> 00:00:09.591
Oh, man.

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.554
- What is that?
- Treeger's snaking the shower drain.

00:00:14.973 --> 00:00:18.225
What in the name of hell?

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:21.937
Maybe he found your flip-flop.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:26.608
- Hey.
- Whoa.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.444
Is this porn?

00:00:29.487 --> 00:00:32.031
What did I do? I must have
hit something on the remote.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.615
Do we pay for this?

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:37.244
No, we didn't even pay our cable bill.

00:00:37.412 --> 00:00:39.747
Maybe this is how they punish us.

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:43.667
Maybe we shouldn't pay our phone bill.
Free phone sex.

00:00:43.835 --> 00:00:47.129
Maybe we shouldn't pay our gas bill.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:52.718
Whoa, hey, that lady's all kinds of naked.

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:57.347
Yeah, Joey just pressed something
on the remote and it just came on.

00:00:59.142 --> 00:01:01.977
It happened to me once. I was flipping
through the channels and, bam.

00:01:02.145 --> 00:01:06.148
- It was like finding money.
- Finding money with naked people on it.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:09.485
Then I made the mistake
of turning off the TV.

00:01:09.652 --> 00:01:11.987
I never got it back again.

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.280
And I'm sad.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.913
Why would he turn off the TV?

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:16.552
All right, you know what? Do we really
have to watch this while we eat?

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.512
No, no, no.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:22.307
We don't know
what could make this go away.

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:27.229
Yeah, so no one touches the remote,
and no one touches the TV.

00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:30.566
And no one touches the air
around the TV.

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:36.572
Imagine a protective porn bubble,
if you will.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.534
- I'm at least going to mute it.
- No, no, no.

00:02:44.706 --> 00:02:46.748
- We still have porn.
- Yeah.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:50.210
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:51.503
Honey, what are you doing?

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.089
- That's too heavy. Give it here.
- Yeah.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.259
Oh, God.

00:02:57.468 --> 00:02:59.303
Okay.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.637
Ugh.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:05.309
I'm getting too pregnant for this...
Lugging around a stupid massage table.

00:03:05.476 --> 00:03:07.811
I have to find a job
where I carry a smaller table.

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.938
Or a job where you don't
have to carry a table.

00:03:10.106 --> 00:03:12.024
You mean, like a doctor?

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:15.694
Pheebs, you're blocking the porn.
Look out.

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:17.196
Oh!

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:18.947
Oh, my.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.618
Oh, that reminds me.
I have to see my ob-gyn today.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.958
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:32.669
So, uh, Emily just went to the airport.

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.546
Aw. Why didn't you take her?

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.465
Ehh, her uncle had planned on doing it.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:40.302
And you know, we said
our goodbyes this morning, so...

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.431
You must feel horrible.
Hey, the guys have free porn.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:48.560
No.

00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:51.730
Hey, cheer up.
You're gonna see her again, right?

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.608
Well, that's the thing. I don't know.

00:03:54.776 --> 00:03:57.027
I mean, whenever I brought it up with her,
she said:

00:03:57.195 --> 00:04:00.614
"This is so fantastic.
Why do we have to talk about the future?

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:03.158
- Let's enjoy..."
- Don't do the accent.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:06.870
You've got to see her again.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.664
Why do you care?

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.165
Because.

00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:12.542
You could get to live out my fantasy.

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:15.170
You've had fantasies about Emily?

00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:19.675
No. You know, the fantasy.

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:21.510
Meet someone from a strange land...

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:24.304
...fall madly in love
and spend the rest of your lives together.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.390
Is that why, in junior high...

00:04:26.557 --> 00:04:29.601
...you were the only one who hung out
with that Ukrainian kid?

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:35.440
Yeah, that, but plus his mom used to put
sour cream on everything.

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:38.068
Do you love her?

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.364
We said it was only gonna be
two weeks, you know?

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.200
You love her.

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:48.370
What is love, really?

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.831
I knew you loved her.

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:53.333
You need to go to the airport
and tell her.

00:04:53.501 --> 00:04:56.378
You're probably gonna catch her
just as she's about to go to the gate.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.548
You're gonna call out her name
and yell, "I love you."

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:01.967
She's gonna say, "I love you too."

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:05.262
Then you guys are gonna have
the most amazing kiss.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.764
Everyone at the gate will applaud.

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:10.851
I am a good kisser.

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:16.064
Then you two can sneak into the cockpit.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.401
Things will start to heat up.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.237
And then a stewardess comes in...

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.907
I've been watching too much porn.

00:05:31.122 --> 00:05:32.831
- Is that the heartbeat?
- That's it.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.167
Oh, my God.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:37.210
Oh, wow. This is so cool.

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:41.548
Have we talked about the possibility
of multiple births?

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:44.384
Why don't we just take care of this one?

00:05:44.552 --> 00:05:47.429
And should I get pregnant again,
I'll hold onto your card, okay?

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.517
No, I'm getting three
separate heartbeats.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:56.229
Three? You guys were worried
I wouldn't even have one.

00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:00.150
- Doctors are wrong all the time.
- Well...

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:04.154
Well, so are you sure
that there are three?

00:06:04.322 --> 00:06:06.907
- Definitely.
- Oh, my God.

00:06:07.492 --> 00:06:11.495
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Ha, ha.

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.789
So in a few months...

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:17.209
...I'm gonna have three full-grown babies
just walking around inside me?

00:06:18.836 --> 00:06:21.421
Oh, oh. And it's gonna be like
one of those log rides...

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:24.132
...when they just come shooting out.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:28.595
Giving birth to three babies is not
that different than giving birth to one.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:30.347
What do you know?

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.314
- Phoebe.
- Oh! Hi.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:43.235
So how'd it go at the doctor's?

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.903
Oh, well, okay. Hey.

00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:47.989
You know how, when you're,
um, walking down the street...

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.951
...and you see three people in a row.

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.162
And you say "Oh, that's nice."

00:06:56.207 --> 00:06:58.500
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:03.004
Yeah, well, good news.
You're gonna have three babies. Aah!

00:07:04.298 --> 00:07:06.383
- Three babies?
Uh-huh.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:08.593
Oh, oh!

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:11.263
I've finally got my band.

00:07:12.181 --> 00:07:16.351
We're gonna have a big family!
I always wanted a big family!

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:21.940
Oh, God. I'm so glad you guys are happy.
I was so afraid you we're gonna be freaked.

00:07:22.108 --> 00:07:24.693
- Oh.
- Why would we be freaked?

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:29.072
No, because maybe it's harder to raise them
and the added expense. Ugh!

00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:34.035
- Oh.
- Right.

00:07:34.829 --> 00:07:37.914
No, back to happy. Back to happy!

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:41.918
No, no, no. It's gonna be fine...

00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:43.545
...because, um...

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.547
Because I teach Home Ec.

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:50.427
And I can have 30 kids making
baby clothes all year long.

00:07:50.595 --> 00:07:55.182
You know, it'll be like
my very own little sweatshop.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:07:58.894
You know, I've been thinking...

00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:01.229
...ever since you said
that we're gonna have triplets.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:08.069
The best thing for me to do is
drop out of college and get a job.

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:10.947
- Frank.
- No, you can't quit college. No.

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.449
You're in college? Really?

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:15.494
- Yeah, refrigerator college.
- Yeah.

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:19.915
Yeah, you know, when we found out
we were gonna have a baby...

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:24.961
...I figured, you know,
I should have, like, a career, you know?

00:08:25.129 --> 00:08:26.963
- And I love refrigerators.
- Yeah.

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.592
You can't give up on your dream. Ugh.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.721
No, it's okay.
We're gonna have three kids.

00:08:34.889 --> 00:08:38.099
And that's a different kind of dream.

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:40.018
Three kids and no money.

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:49.778
This is the boarding call for Flight 009.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:51.780
Emily.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:53.615
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

00:08:54.951 --> 00:08:57.786
I just... I had to see you one more time
before you took off.

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:00.956
You are so sweet.

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:05.752
That's a big candy bar.

00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:10.882
I had the most amazing time with you.

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.802
Me too.

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:17.639
This is the final boarding call
for Flight 009.

00:09:19.308 --> 00:09:20.976
Well, that's me.

00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:30.318
Here, have this.

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:32.487
I'm only allowed one piece
of carry-on anyway.

00:09:36.367 --> 00:09:38.159
Wait, uh...

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:41.955
Listen, I have to tell you something.

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:44.040
I've been thinking.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.836
I'm just going to come out and say it, okay?
Uh...

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:50.255
I think...

00:09:51.048 --> 00:09:52.674
...I love you.

00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:57.012
Oh.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:04.352
Thank you.

00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:14.779
It's no problem.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.206
What is that song
that has been in my head all day?

00:10:25.374 --> 00:10:28.043
It's the theme from Good Will Humping.

00:10:31.547 --> 00:10:33.882
You know who doesn't even like
dirty movies?

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.385
- My new boyfriend Joshua.
- Yeah, right.

00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:42.932
No, he told me he prefers to leave
certain things to the imagination.

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:46.770
Oh, oh, yeah. Did he also say that he
thought some of the dialogue was corny?

00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:49.314
And that he actually found it funny,
not sexy?

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.732
Yes.

00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:54.402
Yeah, he likes porn.

00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:58.490
Where you going?

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:01.951
I'm gonna find out if he really thinks
supermodels are too skinny.

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:04.120
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hi.

00:11:04.288 --> 00:11:06.748
- Hi. Hey.
- How'd it go with Frank and Alice?

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.416
Frank has to quit college...

00:11:08.584 --> 00:11:12.212
...because his super-fertile sister
is having three babies. Ugh.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.631
I need to make a lot of money really fast.

00:11:14.799 --> 00:11:17.092
And I had an idea
that I wanted to talk to you about...

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:19.260
...because you work for a big company.
Okay.

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:20.595
Insider trading.

00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:24.808
What information is there
that you can give me?

00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:27.602
Well, actually, they don't really talk to us
about that stuff.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.771
I can get you some free White-Out,
though.

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:35.360
Huh! Did you do what I said?
Did you tell her?

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.404
- I did.
- And what did she say?

00:11:37.863 --> 00:11:39.072
"Thank you."

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:43.660
You're totally welcome. What'd she say?

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.622
She said, "Thank you."

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.250
I said, "I love you."

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:53.461
And she said, "Thank you."

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:57.757
Oh, wait. Did you say you love her?

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.802
Yeah, what were you trying
to get her to do?

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.805
What do I do now?

00:12:04.348 --> 00:12:06.224
You play hard-to-get.

00:12:07.101 --> 00:12:09.644
She already lives in London.

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:13.189
So you go to Tokyo.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:15.984
All right, look, forget it.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:19.028
Okay, forget it.
You told her you love her. It's over.

00:12:19.196 --> 00:12:22.282
It is not over. You're over.

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:24.993
What?

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.663
You know.

00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:32.459
Okay.

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:35.336
Good one.

00:12:36.547 --> 00:12:40.175
It's not over because she's gonna call you
and tell you she loves you.

00:12:40.342 --> 00:12:43.803
The reason why she couldn't is because her
feelings were so strong that it scared her.

00:12:43.971 --> 00:12:46.055
Now, you go home
and you wait for her call.

00:12:46.223 --> 00:12:48.683
She could be calling you from the plane.
Come on, go.

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:53.104
Okay, okay. But if she doesn't call,
it is definitely over.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:57.984
No, wait, wait. Unless, eventually, I call her,
you know, to see what's going on...

00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:02.530
...and she says she'll call me back,
but then she doesn't.

00:13:02.698 --> 00:13:05.617
Then it's over.

00:13:06.410 --> 00:13:07.744
Way to be strong, man.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.088
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:13:19.256 --> 00:13:21.341
Listen, can we watch cartoons
on your television?

00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:24.010
We need a porn break.

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:28.139
We spent the last two hours watching
In and Out and In Again.

00:13:29.934 --> 00:13:31.976
Well, so why don't you just turn it off?

00:13:32.144 --> 00:13:35.021
Because then we'd be the guys
who turned off free porn.

00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:38.733
Oh, good, you're here.

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:39.943
Hey.

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.402
What you got there?

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.572
Oh, this? Well, I'm glad you asked.

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:50.203
Now, don't you hate it
when you have to cut a tin can...

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:52.705
...with an ordinary steak knife?

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:56.042
Ha.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:57.961
Now, I know what you're thinking.

00:13:58.128 --> 00:14:00.004
Pregnant woman slays four?

00:14:02.341 --> 00:14:04.384
They didn't make you pay
for those knives, did they?

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:06.094
- No.
- Are you sure?

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:08.012
No.

00:14:09.056 --> 00:14:12.100
You're not gonna make enough money
to help Frank and Alice by selling knives.

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:13.351
No, no. I know that.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:16.479
But I just need to make enough money
for the second part of my plan.

00:14:16.647 --> 00:14:20.066
- What's the second part of your plan?
- My Saturn dealership.

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:30.451
Hello?

00:14:31.203 --> 00:14:32.328
Ross?

00:14:32.496 --> 00:14:34.330
Emily. Hi.

00:14:34.707 --> 00:14:38.543
Uh, how was your flight?

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.003
It was dreadful.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.632
Uh, I felt terrible about how I acted
when you said those wonderful things.

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:48.553
No, no, that's all right. Um...

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:51.139
I'm just glad you called.

00:14:51.307 --> 00:14:54.809
Ross, um, there's something
that I've got to tell you.

00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:59.063
There's someone else.

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:07.655
Does that mean the same thing
in England as it does in America?

00:15:09.992 --> 00:15:12.243
She doesn't know
which one of us she wants.

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.329
Me or this "Colin" guy.

00:15:14.496 --> 00:15:17.999
This isn't how it was supposed to go.
I mean, there can't be another guy.

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:19.667
Well...

00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:22.712
Of course there's another guy.

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.923
Heh. This is even more perfect.

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:28.343
Now you have to prove your love.

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:32.680
I'm not proving anything, okay?
I'm done listening to you.

00:15:32.848 --> 00:15:35.892
If I hadn't let you talk me
into going to the airport in the first place...

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.936
...I wouldn't have put my fist
through the wall.

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:39.687
You put your fist through the wall?

00:15:39.855 --> 00:15:42.231
No, I missed and hit the door.

00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:45.526
But it opened really hard.

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:49.530
- You have to go to London.
- What?

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:51.366
Yep. You have to go fight for her.

00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:53.368
Oh, yeah, sure. That makes sense.

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:56.579
Because you already told her you loved her,
and she didn't say it back.

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:59.123
Then she called you and told you
there was another guy.

00:15:59.291 --> 00:16:01.209
So yeah. Go to London.
That will scare her.

00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:06.464
When Rachel was with Paolo,
what did you do?

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:08.591
I made fun of his accent.

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:12.470
You sat back and let him have her.
You didn't fight at all. Am I right?

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:14.931
You want the same thing
to happen with Emily?

00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:16.224
- No.
- All right, then.

00:16:16.392 --> 00:16:19.060
Go fight for her. Go to London.

00:16:19.228 --> 00:16:21.729
I mean, that could be you and Emily.

00:16:24.733 --> 00:16:26.985
That, but nicer.

00:16:27.194 --> 00:16:28.569
Just go to London.

00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:31.280
- Really?
- Come on.

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:35.326
Surprise her. Show up at her doorstep.
Don't let her go without a fight.

00:16:36.245 --> 00:16:39.580
- All right. All right. I'm going to do it.
- All right.

00:16:39.748 --> 00:16:43.042
I'm gonna go to London,
and I am gonna fight for her.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.961
Okay. Good luck.

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:48.339
Ross, Ross. If you're going to the airport...

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:51.509
...can you pick me up another one
of those Toblerone bars?

00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:02.770
Oh, oh, I did it. I did it.
I figured out a way to make money.

00:17:02.938 --> 00:17:06.065
I'm gonna open up my own massage place
and Frank's gonna help me.

00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:09.402
And we can work it around his schedule,
so he doesn't have to quit school.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:11.029
La-la-la.

00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:14.365
That sounds great.
But how can you afford it?

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:16.034
We were walking down the street...

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:18.036
...and we saw that van
you used for catering.

00:17:18.203 --> 00:17:20.621
- And we realized...
- I'm telling it. I'm telling it.

00:17:22.541 --> 00:17:24.500
Okay, you know how people
need transportation...

00:17:24.668 --> 00:17:26.919
...but they also need massages to relax?

00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:31.716
So I just figured we could combine the two.
Okay, I give the massages and Frank drives.

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:35.720
I can fix up the van, bolt the table
in the back and you know what I've got?

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:38.848
A place that no one
will ever get out of alive?

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:45.313
No, think about it. It's a taxi that
people take when they need to relax.

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:47.523
It's a Relaxi-Taxi.

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:51.611
The name was my favorite part.

00:17:52.571 --> 00:17:55.281
- Well, I came up with it.
- You did not!

00:17:55.532 --> 00:17:57.075
Oh!

00:17:57.701 --> 00:18:02.455
No. You came up with Relaxi-Cab.
That's not good.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:07.543
- Hello?
- Hey.

00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:11.214
Oh, my God. Ross, are you in England?
Was Emily surprised?

00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:13.424
No, because she hasn't come home yet.

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.635
And she hasn't been home all night.

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:18.387
She's obviously staying
with that other guy.

00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:22.141
And I'm the stupid moron who spent
the whole night outside her apartment.

00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:24.352
All right, when is the next flight out?

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:25.812
About four hours.

00:18:25.979 --> 00:18:29.690
Okay, just stay there a couple more hours.
If she doesn't show up, come home.

00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:31.901
Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi.

00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:35.404
And ask him if he thinks that is better
than Relaxi-Cab.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.701
It's not Relaxi-Cab.
It's Relaxi-Cab. Like Taxi-Cab.

00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:43.246
Ooh, that is better.

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.880
Are we in London?

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:56.008
Why are you doing here?
You can't be here.

00:18:56.426 --> 00:18:58.261
I've come to talk to Ross.

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:03.182
What?

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:07.728
Nothing. No, nothing.

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:09.730
I was gonna call him...

00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:12.900
Oh, you came to tell him you love him.
I knew it!

00:19:13.068 --> 00:19:15.403
I was right! I'm right, right?

00:19:16.613 --> 00:19:17.989
I'd really rather talk to him.

00:19:20.325 --> 00:19:22.618
I've been to his apartment
and he's not there.

00:19:22.786 --> 00:19:24.620
And I need to talk to him.

00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:27.331
So do you have any idea where he is?

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:39.177
Ross, are you there?

00:19:42.055 --> 00:19:46.475
Ross, I don't know if you can hear this,
but I'm gonna talk anyway.

00:19:46.768 --> 00:19:49.854
I'm in the States
with your sister and your friends.

00:19:50.022 --> 00:19:52.315
And it's all over with Colin.

00:19:53.984 --> 00:19:57.195
I came here to tell you that
and to tell you...

00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:00.531
Yes, Joey, you can have
all the chocolate you want. Just take it.

00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:08.372
I came here to tell you that I love you.

00:20:09.499 --> 00:20:10.666
I love you too.

00:20:10.959 --> 00:20:14.420
I'm gonna call you right now
from the phone booth.

00:20:14.588 --> 00:20:16.714
You can't hear me.

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:20.635
I wish I could know
if you'd heard any of that.

00:20:20.802 --> 00:20:24.222
I suppose I've either told you that I love you
or given my neighbors a good laugh.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:28.726
Mrs. Newman, if you're listening,
bugger off. This is none of your business.

00:20:30.479 --> 00:20:32.438
Suppose there's not much chance
you did hear that.

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:34.815
And there's the call waiting...

00:20:34.983 --> 00:20:38.194
...so I should go.

00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:40.696
Oh, well.

00:20:42.991 --> 00:20:44.367
Hello?

00:20:44.868 --> 00:20:46.327
Hi.

00:20:48.872 --> 00:20:50.957
Ross, I love you.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.750
Oh.

00:20:54.711 --> 00:20:56.295
Thank you.

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.430
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:21:07.182 --> 00:21:10.184
I was just at the bank and there
was this really hot teller.

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:14.438
And she didn't ask me
to go do it with her in the vault.

00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:17.066
Same kind of thing happened to me.

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:19.110
Woman pizza delivery guy comes over...

00:21:19.278 --> 00:21:21.821
...gives me the pizza,
takes the money and leaves.

00:21:21.989 --> 00:21:25.324
What, no "Nice apartment,
bet the bedrooms are huge"?

00:21:26.034 --> 00:21:27.451
No, nothing.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.455
You know what?
We have to turn off the porn.

00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.958
I think you're right.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:37.169
All right, ready?

00:21:37.337 --> 00:21:38.671
- One.
- Two.

00:21:38.839 --> 00:21:40.256
- Three.
- Three.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.845
That's kind of nice.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:49.307
- Yeah, that's kind of a relief.
- Yeah.

00:21:56.064 --> 00:21:58.065
- You want to see if we still have it?
- Yeah.

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:02.486
Free porn! We have free porn!
