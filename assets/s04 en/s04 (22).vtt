WEBVTT

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:09.717
That was the 10th time I've peed
since I've been here.

00:00:09.968 --> 00:00:12.970
It's also, like, the 10th time
you've told us. Ha, ha.

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:15.514
Yeah, oh, I'm sorry,
it must be hard to hear.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.766
I'll tell you, it's easier
having babies playing...

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:21.311
..."Bring in 'da Noise, Bring in 'da Funk"
on your bladder.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:24.982
I am so sick of being pregnant.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:27.276
The only happiness I get
is from a cup of coffee...

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:30.571
...which of course is decaf
because, oh, I'm pregnant. Heh.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.783
Pheebs, you want a cookie?

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.996
Thank you so much.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:44.460
So, uh, Pheebs, honey,
how are those mood swings coming?

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.212
I haven't really had any yet.

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:41.934
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:44.978
All right. Here's the ring.

00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:48.232
Yes, yes. A thousand times, yes.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:52.111
So, uh, any ideas for the bachelor party?

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:53.612
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.406
Before you start handing out rings
and planning bachelor parties...

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:59.409
...don't you have to decide
who your best man's gonna be?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.371
Oh, it's awkward. It's awkward,
it's awkward.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.457
I sort of already asked Chandler.

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:09.002
What? He got to do it
at your first wedding.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.422
Joey, I figured you'd understand.
I've known him a lot longer.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.635
Come on, Ross. I don't have any brothers.
I'm never gonna get to be a best man.

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.595
You can be the best man
when I get married.

00:02:19.848 --> 00:02:22.558
I'm never gonna get to be a best man.

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:25.102
Wait, wait.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.356
So you get to be my best man twice,
and I don't get to be yours at all?

00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:34.444
Oh, no. Yeah, of course,
you can be my best man.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.867
What about me? You just said I could.

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:41.702
I'm not even getting married!

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.038
Okay, this is a question
for science-fiction writers.

00:02:45.206 --> 00:02:47.040
I can't believe you're not picking me.

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:49.793
- Hey, how could it not be me?
- I'm not even...

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.087
- I'm not even...
- All right, you know what? That's it.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.174
From now on,
Joey I want you to be my best man.

00:02:55.758 --> 00:02:58.844
Yes. Shame about you, though.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.684
- Stop it.
- What?

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:07.811
One of the babies is kicking.

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:10.564
- I thought that was a good thing.
- It's not kicking me.

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.191
It's kicking one of the other babies.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.570
Oh. Don't make me come in there!

00:03:18.323 --> 00:03:19.531
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.658
Do you guys have, like,
a big bowl I can borrow?

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:23.744
Yeah, there's one
right under the cabinet.

00:03:23.912 --> 00:03:25.412
- Thanks.
- Why do you need it?

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.873
Oh, we're having a party tomorrow night.
Later.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.667
Hey, hey.
Are you planning on inviting us?

00:03:30.835 --> 00:03:33.212
No. No, no. Later.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.048
Hey, get your ass back here, Tribbiani!

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:40.969
Hormones.

00:03:42.263 --> 00:03:43.263
What Phoebe meant was...

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:45.724
...how come you're having a party
and we're not invited?

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.101
Oh. It's Ross' bachelor party.

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.312
- So?
- Are you bachelors?

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:54.274
- No.
- Are you strippers?

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:58.445
- No.
- Then you're not invited.

00:03:58.613 --> 00:04:02.032
All right, fine. You're not invited
to the party that we're gonna have either.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.451
Oh, what party?

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.204
Well, um...

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.539
The baby shower for Phoebe.

00:04:09.707 --> 00:04:10.749
Baby shower?

00:04:10.917 --> 00:04:14.878
Wow. That so doesn't sound
like something I want to do. Later.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.174
I can't believe I'm going to have a party!

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:22.594
Ha, ha. That's so great. A party!

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:24.638
Yay! Ha, ha.

00:04:31.354 --> 00:04:33.063
- I don't know why.
- Oh.

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:37.359
This is what I got going
for the party so far liquor-wise.

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:40.153
- Get a lot of liquor.
- Great. Great.

00:04:40.321 --> 00:04:44.324
Okay, now, uh, in terms of the invite list,
obviously I got you, me and Chandler.

00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:47.828
And I'm invite Gunther because,
well, we've been talking pretty loud.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:49.496
I'll be there.

00:04:50.623 --> 00:04:52.249
Oh, listen. I know it's your party...

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:55.669
...but I'd really like to limit the number
of museum geeks that are gonna be there.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:59.006
Yeah. Tell you what.
Let's not invite any anthropologists, okay?

00:04:59.173 --> 00:05:01.800
Just the dinosaur dudes.

00:05:04.345 --> 00:05:07.556
Okay, we'll need a six-pack of Zima.

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:10.600
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:15.063
Oh, just planning my bachelor party
with my best man.

00:05:15.231 --> 00:05:17.649
Yeah, well, good luck trying to top
the last one.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:21.236
I don't think it's gonna be that difficult,
considering this one won't take place...

00:05:21.404 --> 00:05:23.947
...in the basement of a Pizza Hut. Heh.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:26.074
Oh, I'm Ross, I'm Ross.

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:28.785
I'm too good for the Hut.
I'm too good for the Hut.

00:05:30.038 --> 00:05:33.206
Look, I gotta go pick up Ben.
Uh, everything so far sounds great, Joey.

00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:35.334
Just remember,
keep it on the mellow side, okay?

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:37.586
Just a couple guys
hanging out playing poker.

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.297
- No strippers or anything, okay?
- You got it.

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:42.549
- Okay, see you later.
- Yeah.

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:46.595
Ha, ha. Have fun planning
your mellow party.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.056
There's gonna be strippers there.

00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:51.558
He didn't say anything
about no strippers.

00:05:54.228 --> 00:05:57.564
- He just said, "No strippers."
- Oh. I chose not to hear that.

00:05:59.984 --> 00:06:02.736
Look what I got, look what I got,
look what I got.

00:06:04.697 --> 00:06:05.906
Oh.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:10.160
Can you believe they made these
for little people?

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:12.371
Aw. Little Village People.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.461
Aw, okay. Look at this one.
This is my favorite.

00:06:19.754 --> 00:06:21.963
Oh, that is so sweet.

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:25.133
Phoebe's gonna love
dressing them in these.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:30.680
Huh. Except, uh, Phoebe's not gonna be
the one who gets to dress them.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:34.810
I guess she's not gonna get
to keep the babies.

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:39.272
Oh, my God, we are throwing
the most depressing baby shower.

00:06:40.775 --> 00:06:43.777
Wait a minute. Unless we give her all gifts
that she can use...

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:47.823
...after she's done being pregnant.
Like, um, regular coffee. Tequila.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:51.034
Oh, and somebody can get her those
leather pants she's always wanted.

00:06:51.202 --> 00:06:52.786
Oh, she's gonna love that.

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:54.538
What the hell is this?

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.458
You actually thought
it'd make me feel better?

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:02.087
To give me something
I can't even use for another two months?

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:03.880
This sucks! Oh!

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.135
All right, what's my next present?

00:07:12.223 --> 00:07:14.474
Hey, listen, man, about the stripper...

00:07:14.642 --> 00:07:16.143
- Yeah?
- Good call.

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:21.148
A little announcement.
A little announcement.

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:25.777
I've decided that my best man
is my best friend Gunther.

00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:30.240
What's my last name?

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:33.076
Central Perk?

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.539
Thanks for not marrying Rachel.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.876
Oh, hey, Gunther.
Don't forget your shirt.

00:07:41.502 --> 00:07:43.128
Hey. Hey, what are those?

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:45.755
Little party favors. Check it out.

00:07:45.923 --> 00:07:47.841
Wow, yeah.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:50.051
Oh, oh, oh!

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:51.720
Aw.

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:54.055
Okay, little announcement.

00:07:54.223 --> 00:07:58.059
Just want everybody to know
the position of my best man is still open.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:08:02.272
And, uh, you know,
so is the position of the bride.

00:08:03.524 --> 00:08:04.900
Great.

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:08.570
Smooth, man.
Yeah. You got some chili on your neck.

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:15.702
Well, I just want to say thanks, everyone.
This was great.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:18.413
Okay? And hey, I'll see you guys
Monday morning.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.585
- Thanks, Joey.
- Oh, hey. Don't forget your shirt.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:24.961
Oh, thanks.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:30.884
Ahem. Okay. Hey, museum geeks.
Party's over.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:34.513
Okay, wave bye-bye to the nice lady.
There you go.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.974
Back to your parents' basement.
All right.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.897
Come on, boys, come on out.
Here you go.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.942
Oh. Look at the birdies.

00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:48.735
- Are those yours?
- Yeah.

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.738
Wow, I didn't know they let you keep
chickens and ducks as pets?

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.533
Oh, yeah, yeah.
And I got the duck totally trained too.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:57.619
Watch this. Stare at the wall.

00:08:58.746 --> 00:09:00.372
Hardly move.

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:03.208
Be white.

00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:07.379
You are really good at that.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:09.673
- Oh.
- So I had fun tonight.

00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:11.841
You throw one hell of a party.

00:09:12.009 --> 00:09:13.927
Thanks, thanks.
Yeah, it was great meeting you.

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:18.974
And listen, if any of my friends ever get
married or have a birthday or a Tuesday...

00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:21.476
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Okay. Ha, ha.

00:09:22.436 --> 00:09:25.063
So, I guess, um, good night.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.775
Oh, unless you, uh...
Unless you want to hang around.

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:32.487
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I'll let you play with my duck.

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:46.668
Hey...

00:09:49.338 --> 00:09:51.047
Stripper.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.981
The stripper stole the ring!

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:11.943
Chandler, get up, get up!
The stripper stole the ring!

00:10:12.111 --> 00:10:14.070
- What?
- The ring is gone!

00:10:14.238 --> 00:10:19.117
Oh. Okay, just, like, give me a minute
to wake up for this.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:24.706
You lost the ring.
You're the worst best man ever.

00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:28.043
Dude, this isn't funny.
What am I gonna do?

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.170
I go to sleep last night,
everything's cool.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:33.381
I wake up this morning, the stripper's gone,
and the ring is gone!

00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:35.508
- You slept with the stripper?
- Of course!

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:39.471
Hi, guys.

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:42.057
Hi, Phoebe.

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:47.395
Ahem. I wanted to apologize if I, you know,
seemed a tad edgy yesterday...

00:10:47.563 --> 00:10:49.230
...at my shower.

00:10:49.523 --> 00:10:51.399
You know, it's just the hormones.
You know?

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.985
- No, we... Hormones. Yeah.
- Hormones.

00:10:54.195 --> 00:10:57.238
Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you.
It was just... It was so sweet.

00:10:57.448 --> 00:10:59.991
- Oh, okay.
- So sweet.

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:04.746
- Yeah.
- Wow, you seem to be doing much better.

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:08.208
- That's great. How are things going?
- Good.

00:11:08.376 --> 00:11:11.711
No, but... Okay, it feels like everything's
been about me lately.

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:13.463
So, what's happening with you?

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:18.259
Oh. Well, actually, we were just talking
about me not going to Ross' wedding.

00:11:18.427 --> 00:11:19.969
- Oh.
- It just might be too hard...

00:11:20.137 --> 00:11:22.555
...given the history and all that.

00:11:22.723 --> 00:11:26.893
Wow, this reminds me of the time
when I was, um, living on the street.

00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:30.897
And this guy offered to buy me food
if I slept with him.

00:11:33.776 --> 00:11:35.777
Well, how is this like that?

00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:40.031
Well, let's see. It's not really like that.

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:42.826
Because, you see,
that was an actual problem.

00:11:42.993 --> 00:11:46.454
And, uh, yours is just, like, a bunch
of high-school crap...

00:11:46.622 --> 00:11:49.332
...that nobody really gives... Yeah.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.673
Well, I'm sorry. I just thought...

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:59.008
All right, here come the waterworks.

00:12:01.011 --> 00:12:02.512
Oh. I don't know what I'm gonna do.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.181
I called the company that sent her,
and they don't care.

00:12:05.349 --> 00:12:07.434
And I called 911 and they yelled at me.

00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:09.519
If this isn't an emergency, then what is?

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.815
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.902
I just wanted to thank you for last night.
What a great party.

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:19.821
And the guys from work had a blast.

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:23.074
You know, one of them had never been
to a bachelor party before.

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:27.287
Yeah, and another one had never been
to a party before, so...

00:12:29.039 --> 00:12:31.458
So, uh, hey, that wedding ring, huh?

00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:35.211
- Man, that is nice.
- Yeah. Yeah, right?

00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:38.882
Yeah, I was thinking I might pick one
of those babies up for myself.

00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:41.760
Where might one get one of those?

00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:46.097
That ring, when my grandmother
first came to this country...

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:50.560
...that ring and the clothes on her back
were all she had with her.

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:57.108
So you might say
that the ring is irreplaceable.

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:01.196
Oh, absolutely.
It's been in my family for generations.

00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:05.366
And every bride who's worn it
has lived a long and happy life.

00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:09.245
So you might say it's a magic ring.

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:16.377
Yeah, the stripper stole it.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.964
My ring? My wedding ring?

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:23.843
The stripper stole my wedding ring?

00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:26.262
How? How could this happen?

00:13:26.430 --> 00:13:30.642
Well, I think it all started when you said,
"Hey, Joey, why don't you be my best man."

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.730
All right, all right. Fine.
I'm gonna call the cops.

00:13:35.981 --> 00:13:39.317
Dude, I screwed up.
You don't have to turn me in.

00:13:39.485 --> 00:13:43.488
- Not on you, on the stripper.
- Oh, yeah, well, I already did that.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:47.075
They said they're gonna look into it
right after they solve all the murders...

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.203
Okay, we'll call the company
that sent her.

00:13:50.371 --> 00:13:51.538
I did that too.

00:13:51.705 --> 00:13:53.623
They wouldn't give me
her name or number.

00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:56.042
They said if I bother them again,
they'd call the police.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.254
I said, "You talk to the police,
you tell them I'm missing a ring."

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:03.675
So, what, Joey? What are you telling me?
That there's nothing we can do?

00:14:03.843 --> 00:14:09.138
- How could this happen?
- Look, Ross, I am so, so sorry.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:15.353
Well, what if we just, uh, called her...

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:18.523
...used a fake name
and had her come to my office?

00:14:18.691 --> 00:14:22.360
Oh, that sounds like fun,
but we got a ring to find!

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:31.077
Here's your tea, Phoebe.

00:14:36.584 --> 00:14:39.085
Mm. It's so good.

00:14:40.087 --> 00:14:41.546
Oh, thanks. That's sweet.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:44.674
- Good.
- So glad you like it.

00:14:44.842 --> 00:14:46.259
- Oh.
- What?

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:48.261
What? She made the tea.

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:52.473
No, I think I just had a contraction.

00:14:52.641 --> 00:14:53.683
- You what?
- My God.

00:14:53.851 --> 00:14:56.144
Yeah, I thought I felt one
a couple minutes ago.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:15:00.189
- And now I know that definitely was one.
- Well, you can't have the baby here!

00:15:00.357 --> 00:15:02.901
I haven't sterilized the apartment
since the guys moved out!

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:04.527
It's okay. We're gonna be okay.

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:08.948
You know what? It's okay. I'm gonna boil
some water and just rip up some sheets.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.243
Ow, it's all right.
It's probably false labor.

00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:14.746
They said that, that can happen
near the end. So just...

00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:16.706
- Somebody get the book.
- Rachel, get the book.

00:15:16.874 --> 00:15:20.418
The book. Okay. Okay. Here.

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:23.254
- The Bible?
- I don't know!

00:15:28.802 --> 00:15:30.261
All right. Okay, okay. This is great.

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:32.597
Uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk.

00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:36.267
And when she comes in, hopefully
she won't recognize you because...

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:38.061
Well, why would she?

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:41.022
Uh, okay. And then you buzz Ross and I.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:45.026
You be Mr. Gonzales,
and I'll be Mr. Wong.

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:48.071
Diverse.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.742
Anybody call for security?

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:55.787
You be cool.

00:16:00.876 --> 00:16:04.504
Okay. Which one of you guys
is Gunther Central Perk?

00:16:06.382 --> 00:16:07.465
Hey, Joey.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:11.678
Where's my ring? My dead grandmother's
wedding ring! Where is it? Where is it?

00:16:13.222 --> 00:16:15.431
Way to be cool, man.

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:17.934
- What's he talking about?
- Oh!

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:20.436
There was a ring in a box
on my nightstand.

00:16:20.604 --> 00:16:22.230
After you left, it was gone.

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:24.524
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?

00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:26.025
Yeah.

00:16:27.319 --> 00:16:30.488
We know you took it!
So just save yourself the time and confess.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.407
Okay, Who are you, the Hardy Boys?

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:38.371
I don't need to steal some stupid ring.

00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:41.082
I make $1,600 a week doing what I do.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.167
Any of you guys make that?

00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:45.586
Marry me.

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:52.802
I don't get it. It was in my room all night.
If she didn't take it...

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.305
...and I didn't take it and you didn't take it.
Then who did?

00:16:58.225 --> 00:17:00.810
Shh. We're trying to think.

00:17:14.533 --> 00:17:17.452
I still don't get how you know
when it's false labor.

00:17:17.619 --> 00:17:19.120
Well, do you see any babies?

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:24.959
- How do you feel?
- Okay, I guess. I mean...

00:17:25.335 --> 00:17:27.211
I don't know.

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:30.506
I guess I know it's going
to be over soon so...

00:17:30.674 --> 00:17:32.091
But isn't that a good thing?

00:17:32.259 --> 00:17:37.180
- I mean, you said you were sick of this.
- I know.

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:40.141
It's just usually, when you're done
with the pregnant thing...

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.685
...then you get to do the mom thing.

00:17:44.063 --> 00:17:49.484
I'm gonna be, you know, sitting around
in my leather pants, drinking tequila.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.863
Some moms do that.

00:17:54.782 --> 00:17:56.074
Yeah, that's even sadder.

00:17:57.576 --> 00:18:01.788
Look, I know what I got myself into,
you know?

00:18:01.955 --> 00:18:06.375
It's just that now that they're in me,
it's like...

00:18:06.835 --> 00:18:09.420
It's like I know them, you know, and...

00:18:11.173 --> 00:18:14.926
It just not gonna be easy when, you know,
these little babies have to go away.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.637
Oh. I know, sweetie.

00:18:17.805 --> 00:18:20.056
But it's not like
you're not gonna have anything.

00:18:20.224 --> 00:18:22.225
I mean, you're gonna have
nieces and nephews.

00:18:22.392 --> 00:18:23.935
In some ways, that's even better.

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:27.021
- Yeah, okay.
- No, really.

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.439
Really, Pheebs.

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:32.026
I mean, you're not gonna be the one
worrying about saving for college.

00:18:32.194 --> 00:18:34.779
Or yelling at them when they're bad.

00:18:34.947 --> 00:18:36.823
You know?
Or deciding to put them on Ritalin...

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.699
...when they just won't calm down.

00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:40.701
You know?

00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:43.830
You're gonna be the one they come to
when they run away from home.

00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:45.790
And the one they talk to about sex.

00:18:45.999 --> 00:18:48.167
You just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe.

00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:52.588
Cool Aunt Phoebe.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.382
I am pretty cool.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.050
Oh.

00:18:56.218 --> 00:19:00.680
Yeah, and you know what else?
Oh, my God, are they going to love you.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.891
- They are going to love me.
- Oh!

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.395
- Thanks, you guys. Again.
- Aw.

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:09.981
Oh, sweetie.

00:19:12.109 --> 00:19:14.110
- Thanks. Oh!
- What? Oh, God.

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:15.778
Just kidding.

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:18.197
- Ah!
- Oh, my God.

00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:20.283
Got you again. You're so easy.

00:19:24.454 --> 00:19:28.583
- If anything should happen to him...
- Joey, the vet said it's a simple procedure.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:32.503
So? Things can go wrong. You don't know.
What if he doesn't make it?

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.590
- He will, Joe.
- Yeah, but what if he doesn't?

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:37.884
He's such a good duck.

00:20:17.633 --> 00:20:19.342
I'm so worried about him.

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.720
- Somebody lose a ring?
- Aah!

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:26.307
Oh, my God.
Thank you. Thank you so much. Aah!

00:20:29.853 --> 00:20:31.395
How's the duck?

00:20:31.563 --> 00:20:33.481
He's doing just fine.
You'll see him in a bit.

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:35.107
- Oh.
- Great.

00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:38.027
Oh, hey, listen, Ross,
thanks for being so cool about this.

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:40.279
- No, that's all right.
- No, it's not.

00:20:40.447 --> 00:20:43.783
I mean, you made me your best man
and I totally let you down.

00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:46.285
- Hey, come on. It's not your fault.
- Yeah, it is.

00:20:46.453 --> 00:20:48.746
You wouldn't have lost the ring, right?

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:51.624
You know what?
Ross, you were right from the start.

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:53.918
- He should be your best man.
- No, you should.

00:20:54.086 --> 00:20:56.045
- Look, don't argue with me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:58.047
I get to choose my best man.

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.592
I want both you guys.

00:21:03.178 --> 00:21:04.887
Really?

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:08.724
Both you guys should be
up there with me.

00:21:08.892 --> 00:21:10.393
I mean, you two are my...

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:15.356
I mean, I'm lucky to have just one good...

00:21:17.192 --> 00:21:19.068
Well, thanks, man.

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:23.281
I got to go check something, okay?

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:30.871
- What a baby.
- Total wuss.
