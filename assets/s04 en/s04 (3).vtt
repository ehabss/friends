WEBVTT

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:05.713
Hey. We are so in luck.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.465
Treeger said we could have
all this cool stuff from the basement.

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:10.509
Wait right there.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.095
Oh, no, no. I'm paddling away.

00:00:14.723 --> 00:00:15.931
Huh?

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.643
Wow. Really?
We got all this rusty crap for free?

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:23.856
Uh-huh.
This and a bunch of bubble wrap...

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.316
...and some of it is not even popped.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:35.909
Could we be more white trash?

00:01:26.711 --> 00:01:28.754
How desperate am I?

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:32.257
Oh, good thing Chandler's not here.
He always wins at this game.

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.469
I just told my mom
I'd cater her party for her.

00:01:35.637 --> 00:01:38.138
- How come?
- Because I need the money.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:42.810
And I thought it'd be a great way to get rid
of that last little smidgen of self-respect.

00:01:42.977 --> 00:01:44.937
Come on, I think this is a good thing.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.688
I don't think Mom would've hired you...

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.857
...if she didn't think you were good
at what you do.

00:01:49.234 --> 00:01:52.444
You don't have to stick up for her.
She can't hear you.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:57.032
Hey, um, do you guys have any juice?

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.575
Just pickle.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.703
Hey, uh, Rach. Funny story.

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:03.789
I bumped into Joanna
on the street yesterday.

00:02:04.874 --> 00:02:07.543
My boss, Joanna?
Wow, that must have been awkward.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.420
Well, no. Actually, she asked me
if I wanted to get a drink.

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:15.134
You, uh, didn't say yes to that, did you?

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.554
Ha, ha. No. No.

00:02:18.721 --> 00:02:20.347
Hello, Rachel.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.103
Well, not at first.

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:29.273
What is she doing here?

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:36.238
I don't understand.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.574
Last time you went out with her,
you said she was a dud.

00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:40.200
I think I judged her too quickly.

00:02:40.368 --> 00:02:43.579
And this time, we were able
to take the relationship to the next level.

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:51.378
Well, last time, I almost got fired.
You must end it. You must end it now.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.922
It's not like this is an everyday occurrence
for me.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.466
I mean, usually I'm pretty much
in there by myself.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:02.973
Chandler.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.893
Promise me you will end it.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.897
- Okay. I promise I'll end it.
- Thank you.

00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:11.899
But I hope you know
what I'm giving up for you.

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.484
Because she's not just the boss
in your office.

00:03:14.652 --> 00:03:16.153
You know what I mean?

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:17.779
Yeah.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.492
Oh, sorry. I knew what he meant.

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.875
How's the hired help?

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.502
Doing great. Quiches are coming along.

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.796
What's this? Blue nail polish?

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:37.758
Yeah, I thought it was cute.

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:41.386
Ha. It's what your grandmother's hands
looked like when we found her.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.516
Let me ask you a question.

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.185
Why did you hire me?

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:51.396
Oh, well, Richard raved
about the food at his party...

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.315
...of course, you were sleeping with him.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:56.860
Then I heard the food at that
lesbian wedding was very nice.

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.947
I assume you weren't sleeping
with anyone there.

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:02.491
Though,
at least that would be something.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:07.037
Oh, my God. Did you hear that?

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.706
She hired me because
she thinks I'm good.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.502
Okay, I didn't hear that.

00:04:14.963 --> 00:04:17.256
Yeah. She didn't hire me out of pity.

00:04:17.423 --> 00:04:19.675
It wasn't so she could pick on me
in front of her friends.

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:21.593
She actually thinks I'm good.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:25.347
Wow. And hey, it's cool if you're a lesbian.
Ha, ha.

00:04:40.738 --> 00:04:44.032
Good afternoon. Are you
the decision-maker of the house?

00:04:44.575 --> 00:04:45.951
Uh...

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:53.417
Do you, uh, currently own
a set of encyclopedias?

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:57.546
No, no, but, uh, try the classifieds.
People sell everything in there.

00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:00.674
Actually, I'm not buying. I'm selling.

00:05:00.842 --> 00:05:02.718
Let me ask you one question.

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:05.721
Do your friends ever have
a conversation...

00:05:05.888 --> 00:05:07.389
...and you just nod along...

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:10.434
...even though you're not really sure
what they're talking about?

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:18.233
I'm telling you,
it's totally unconstitutional.

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.652
- I hear you. Yeah it is.
- I totally agree.

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.448
I think he deserves a Nobel Prize.

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.408
No.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:31.246
It was like the Algonquin kids' table.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:36.960
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:39.671
You haven't said anything
for about two and a half minutes.

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.090
Are you at all interested?

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:45.761
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, oh, yeah. Come on in.
Come on.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.349
- That's weird.
- What?

00:05:50.516 --> 00:05:51.641
Your nails.

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:53.226
Oh, I know. I never wear fake ones.

00:05:53.394 --> 00:05:56.188
I just did it so my mom wouldn't
give me grief about biting them.

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:59.566
No, I meant it's weird that
you only have nine now.

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.112
Oh, my God.

00:06:05.114 --> 00:06:06.615
Wait a minute.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.575
I had them when I put...

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:10.494
Oh, my God. It's in the quiche.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.830
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, don't panic.

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:16.208
I'm gonna go to the store,
get you another set of nails.

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:19.252
No one is gonna know,
and you're gonna look great.

00:06:20.963 --> 00:06:24.466
Oh. Oh, it's because they're gonna eat...
That's the problem.

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:27.928
Honey, don't bite your nails.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.974
Okay, uh, please don't freak out.

00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:37.145
Um, but there's a blue fingernail
in one of the quiche cups.

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.731
And there's no way to know which one.

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:45.612
And whoever finds it wins the prize.

00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:48.323
Ha, ha. I'm not freaking out.

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.658
Why are you laughing?

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:52.202
It's nothing. It's just that now
your father owes me $5.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.371
Ha, ha. What, you bet I'd lose a nail?

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:57.999
Oh, no, don't be silly.
I just bet that I'd need these.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:06:59.918
- Frozen lasagnas?
- Mm.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:04.089
You bet that I'd screw up?

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.842
So all that stuff about hiring me
because I was good was...

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:08.552
No, that was all true.

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:11.513
This was just in case you
pulled a Monica.

00:07:12.056 --> 00:07:15.684
You promised Dr. Weinberg
you'd never use that phrase.

00:07:15.852 --> 00:07:18.186
Honey, come on. Have a sense of humor.

00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:20.397
You're never able to laugh at yourself.

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.691
That's right. Ha, ha.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:25.777
My mom doesn't have any faith in me.
Oh, that's hilarious.

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.656
I don't get it.

00:07:31.075 --> 00:07:32.826
No. I have faith.

00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:35.120
No. You have lasagnas.

00:07:42.670 --> 00:07:44.171
Oh, the ruined quiches are ready.

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:55.849
It just doesn't feel
like we're breaking up.

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:59.769
No, we are. I'm sad.

00:08:00.897 --> 00:08:02.564
Okay.

00:08:05.443 --> 00:08:06.902
Yes?

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.489
Uh, can you wait till tomorrow? All right.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.700
Unbelievable.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:15.785
Thanks.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:19.206
No, no. That was my boss. I have to go.

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:20.957
Okay.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:22.584
What are you doing?

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.586
- I'm getting dressed.
- Why?

00:08:25.254 --> 00:08:28.131
When I walk outside naked,
people throw garbage at me.

00:08:28.925 --> 00:08:31.468
Wait. I want to show you something.

00:08:32.136 --> 00:08:33.637
What is it?

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:36.264
Just a little gag gift somebody gave me.

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.099
Put your hands together.

00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:41.978
You're not the boss of me.

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.815
Yeah, you are.

00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:50.612
Hmm. Saucy.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.827
I'll be back in two minutes.

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:01.331
You're, uh...?
You're going to leave me like this?

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:05.460
Knowing you're here waiting for me,
I think that's kind of exciting, don't you?

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.963
Okay, but if you don't come back soon...

00:09:09.298 --> 00:09:12.008
...there's pretty much nothing
I can do about it.

00:09:14.428 --> 00:09:17.472
- Oh.
- Hi. I brought you back a macaroon.

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:20.475
Oh, great. I'll keep it in my butt
with your nose.

00:09:28.192 --> 00:09:29.651
That's weird. She locked the door.

00:09:29.819 --> 00:09:33.029
You know why?
She's got the Christmas bonus list in there.

00:09:33.197 --> 00:09:34.906
I saw her working on it this morning.

00:09:35.783 --> 00:09:37.993
Okay, swear you won't tell.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.620
But when Mark left,
he gave me a key to Joanna's office.

00:09:40.955 --> 00:09:43.582
- You want to see the list?
- Yeah.

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:55.135
Hi.

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:58.263
How are you?

00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.163
Hello, Joanna...

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.376
-'s office.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.213
I'm sorry. I may be a little longer.

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:35.008
- How little?
- A couple hours. I feel awful.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.510
Look, this isn't funny.
You get back here now.

00:10:37.678 --> 00:10:38.970
- I can't.
- Why not?

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:40.930
I'm in my boss' car.

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:43.016
- What?
- Uh-oh, tunnel.

00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:01.660
What?

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:04.663
Rachel, could I see you for a moment?

00:11:11.879 --> 00:11:14.422
Okay, here's the situation. Ahem.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.966
The keys to the cuffs
are on the back of the door.

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:18.551
Could you be a doll...

00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:22.055
...and grab them and scoot on over here
and unlock me?

00:11:23.307 --> 00:11:26.893
And on a totally separate subject,
that is a lovely pantsuit.

00:11:29.313 --> 00:11:32.315
You promised you would
break up with her.

00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:36.653
I did break up with her.
She just took it really, really well.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:42.450
And the fact that you were jeopardizing
my career never entered your mind?

00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:44.035
It did enter my mind.

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:48.206
But then something happened
that made it shoot right out.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.875
You know what, Chandler?

00:11:51.043 --> 00:11:54.129
You got yourself into those cuffs,
you get yourself out them.

00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:57.882
No, no, no.
I can't get myself right out of them.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:12:01.136
You must have me confused
with the Amazing Chandler.

00:12:02.179 --> 00:12:03.722
Come on, you have to unlock me.

00:12:03.889 --> 00:12:06.433
She could be gone for hours,
and I'm cold and...

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.813
Ugh! Chandler. All right. This is it.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:13.481
You never see Joanna again.

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:14.899
Never.

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:18.236
- You never come into this office again.
- Fine.

00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:21.156
- You give me back my Walkman.
- I...

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.075
I never borrowed your Walkman.

00:12:25.202 --> 00:12:26.911
Well, then I lost it. You buy me one.

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:30.790
You got it. Here we go.
Come on. This is great.

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:34.544
- Aw.
- Does it hurt?

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:38.965
No, I just always see guys doing this
when they get handcuffs taken off.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:43.511
Hello, sweet pants.

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:46.681
Wait a minute.
What are you gonna tell Joanna?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.683
About what?

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:52.854
When she sees that you're gone, she's gonna
know I let you out and I'm gonna get fired.

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.190
I'll make something up.
I'm good at lying.

00:12:55.357 --> 00:12:57.150
I actually did borrow your Walkman.

00:12:57.735 --> 00:13:00.737
No, there's nothing to make up.
She's gonna know I have a key to her office.

00:13:00.905 --> 00:13:02.947
I've gotta get you locked
back the way you were.

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:05.658
Oh, I don't think so.

00:13:16.837 --> 00:13:18.338
Well, this is much better.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.802
So here's somebody interesting, Joey.

00:13:23.969 --> 00:13:26.387
What do you know about Van Gogh?

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:29.140
- Uh, he cut off his ear.
- And?

00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:31.184
I'm out.

00:13:31.811 --> 00:13:33.394
He painted that.

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.523
Wow. That's pretty nice.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.567
I thought he cut off his ear
because he sucked.

00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:42.695
- What else you got in there?
- Let's see, uh...

00:13:43.113 --> 00:13:45.490
- Where does the Pope live?
- In the woods.

00:13:47.284 --> 00:13:49.828
Wait, wait, that's the joke answer.

00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:52.831
Actually, it's Vatican City.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:56.668
Now, uh, what do you know about,
uh, vulcanized rubber?

00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:58.753
Spock's birth control.

00:14:00.923 --> 00:14:03.007
You need these books.

00:14:08.013 --> 00:14:10.139
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:12.725
This used to be your room?

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:16.229
Wow. Oh, you must have been in
really good shape as a kid.

00:14:18.607 --> 00:14:21.359
Oh, I'm such an idiot.

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:24.529
I can't believe I actually thought
she could change.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:27.448
Look, who cares what your mom thinks?

00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:29.742
So you pulled a Monica.

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:33.037
Oh, good. I'm glad that's catching on.

00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:36.791
Why does that have to be a bad thing?
Just change what it means.

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:39.544
You know, go down there
and prove your mother wrong.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:43.381
You finish the job you were hired to do
and we'll call that "pulling a Monica."

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:45.049
What?

00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:49.178
Okay, um, if a kid gets straight A's,
his parents would say:

00:14:49.346 --> 00:14:50.889
"Yeah, you pulled a Monica." Ha, ha.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:56.269
Oh, or a fireman saves a baby, and they go,
"Yeah, no, he pulled a Monica."

00:14:57.938 --> 00:15:00.648
Or someone hits a home run,
and the announcer says:

00:15:00.816 --> 00:15:02.358
"Yeah, that one's out of here."

00:15:02.526 --> 00:15:04.527
Because some things don't change.

00:15:06.071 --> 00:15:08.573
All right. I'll go down there.

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:12.076
But I'm not gonna serve the lasagna.
I'm gonna serve something that I make.

00:15:12.661 --> 00:15:13.870
Wait.

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:18.041
Ooh.

00:15:18.459 --> 00:15:20.627
Oh! Wow.

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:23.630
Wow, my breasts are really strong.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:30.595
Chandler.

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:33.640
Chandler, please. I have to get you
locked up back the way you were.

00:15:33.807 --> 00:15:35.600
I'm so going to lose my job.

00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:38.853
She's very private about her office.

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:40.897
Now I know why.

00:15:41.065 --> 00:15:43.107
Hey, look.
You're in trouble either way, okay?

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:45.777
If she comes and sees me
locked to this instead of the chair...

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:49.489
...she's gonna know you were in here.
So you might as well just let me go.

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:55.370
- I'll clean your bathroom for a month.
- Still wouldn't be clean.

00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:58.873
All I want is my freedom.

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:01.960
- Foot rubs for a month.
- Freedom.

00:16:02.127 --> 00:16:04.337
I'll take all your photos
and put them into albums.

00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:06.005
Freedom. I want my freedom.

00:16:06.173 --> 00:16:08.466
Why won't you hear me?
Sophie, help me.

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:10.885
- Help me.
- Sophie, sit.

00:16:12.888 --> 00:16:14.847
God, would you just calm down?

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:24.983
I'm going to say this for the last time.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:27.819
Would you please just...?

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:34.409
Wow, there's a lot I didn't know
about vomit.

00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:39.747
In a minute.

00:16:41.583 --> 00:16:42.917
So, what do you say, Joey?

00:16:43.085 --> 00:16:46.879
You get the whole set
of encyclopedias for $1200.

00:16:47.047 --> 00:16:49.841
That works out to just 50 bucks a book.

00:16:50.009 --> 00:16:51.884
Twelve hundred dollars?

00:16:53.679 --> 00:16:56.264
You think I have $1200?

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:58.182
I'm home in the middle of the day...

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:01.310
...and I got patio furniture
in my living room.

00:17:02.521 --> 00:17:05.898
I guess there's a few things
you don't get from book learning.

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:08.192
Well, uh, what can you swing?

00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:13.031
How about zero down and zero a month
for a long, long time?

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:16.367
You don't have anything?

00:17:16.535 --> 00:17:19.162
You want to see what I got? Okay.

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:22.582
I got a baby Tootsie Roll...

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.918
...a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex...

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:29.881
...a rock...

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:32.050
...and an army man.

00:17:32.885 --> 00:17:36.304
Okay, I get the picture.
Uh, thanks for your time.

00:17:37.181 --> 00:17:38.890
And a fifty.

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:41.517
Huh. These must be Chandler's pants.

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:44.228
For 50 bucks you can get one book.

00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:47.356
What will it be? A? B? C?

00:17:47.524 --> 00:17:49.150
I think I'm gonna stick with the V.

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:52.320
I want to see how this bad boy turns out.
Heh.

00:17:55.991 --> 00:17:59.160
I, uh, will buy and wrap
all of your Christmas gifts.

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.079
- No.
- Oh.

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:04.707
I, uh... Oh, I'll squeeze you
fresh orange juice every morning.

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:06.417
- With extra pulp?
- Yeah.

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.044
No.

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.299
I've got it.

00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:15.635
You don't have it.

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:18.179
I have so got it.

00:18:18.347 --> 00:18:21.432
There's gonna be rumors about this.
There's no way to stop it.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:23.518
Sophie knows,
Monica and Phoebe know.

00:18:23.685 --> 00:18:25.728
- How do Monica and Phoebe know?
- Oh, I called them.

00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.607
When they ask me what I saw...

00:18:29.775 --> 00:18:32.777
...I can be very generous...

00:18:34.446 --> 00:18:36.614
...or very stingy.

00:18:38.867 --> 00:18:42.870
- Go on.
- I can make you a legend.

00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:46.999
I can make you this generation's
Milton Berle.

00:18:47.876 --> 00:18:51.379
- And Milton Berle has...
- Oh. Not compared to you.

00:18:55.717 --> 00:18:57.802
- Well?
- They're not even touching the lasagna.

00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.012
- Really?
- Oh, they love your casserole.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.305
Yes.

00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:05.393
It's hard to believe, just a little while ago,
this was nothing but ingredients.

00:19:07.563 --> 00:19:10.106
Everyone seems to like your dish.

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:11.858
And you?

00:19:12.025 --> 00:19:13.943
I thought it was...

00:19:14.945 --> 00:19:16.445
...quite tasty.

00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:20.741
So if everyone liked it, and you liked it...

00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:24.203
...that would make this a success.
Which would make you...

00:19:24.454 --> 00:19:25.913
A bitch?

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:29.834
Well, I was going for "wrong,"
but we can use your word.

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.921
Yes, well, I was wrong.

00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:36.257
And I have to say...

00:19:37.092 --> 00:19:39.051
...you really impressed me today.

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:42.096
Wow.

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:45.266
Um, you might even say
that she pulled a Monica.

00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:50.271
She doesn't know we switched it.

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:54.984
And the next time you cater for me...

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.404
...there will be nothing but ice
in the freezer.

00:19:58.947 --> 00:20:00.948
Well, that really means a lot.

00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:03.201
Oh, Mom, don't bite your nails.

00:20:09.833 --> 00:20:12.043
- Hello.
- Hey.

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:14.545
Hello, Chandler.

00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:17.715
I love you.

00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:19.967
Hey, what's going on?

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:21.385
Oh.

00:20:24.389 --> 00:20:26.599
No, he doesn't.

00:20:29.102 --> 00:20:30.728
Two hours, that lasted.

00:20:32.272 --> 00:20:34.232
So did you break up with Joanna?

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:35.733
I think so.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:39.904
Well, it's a good thing you got out when
you did, before she blew up like Vesuvius.

00:20:40.906 --> 00:20:42.406
- The volcano?
- Yeah.

00:20:42.699 --> 00:20:47.703
And speaking of volcanoes, man,
are they a violent, igneous-rock formation.

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:49.747
What?

00:20:49.998 --> 00:20:52.708
Oh, yeah. Lava spewing, hot ash.

00:20:52.876 --> 00:20:54.710
Of course, some are dormant.

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:57.922
Why are you talking about volcanoes
all of a sudden?

00:20:58.090 --> 00:20:59.548
Oh, we can talk about something else.

00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:01.842
What do you want to talk about?
Vivisection?

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.388
The vas deferens?

00:21:05.847 --> 00:21:07.765
The Vietnam War?

00:21:08.308 --> 00:21:11.310
Oh, did anybody see that documentary
on the Korean War?

00:21:11.478 --> 00:21:13.437
Oh, yeah.

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.314
Oh, God,
Korea's such a beautiful country.

00:21:15.482 --> 00:21:18.693
- With such a sad history.
- Yeah.

00:21:19.152 --> 00:21:20.361
Could there be more Kims?

00:21:29.871 --> 00:21:32.248
- Who's out there?
- It's me. Good morning.

00:21:32.416 --> 00:21:34.375
Rachel, could you come in here a moment?

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:37.545
Yeah, sure. Um, they didn't have
poppy-seed bagels...

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:40.089
...so I have sesame ones... Oh, my word.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.383
I...

00:21:42.884 --> 00:21:45.094
I seem to have had
a slight office mishap.

00:21:46.972 --> 00:21:48.848
Could you get the key
off the back of the door?

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:51.642
Yeah, sure. I...

00:21:56.189 --> 00:21:57.732
I'm so sorry.

00:21:57.899 --> 00:22:00.693
Tell your friend Chandler
that we're definitely broken up this time.

00:22:00.861 --> 00:22:02.153
Okay.
