WEBVTT

00:00:05.088 --> 00:00:06.463
Hey, new wallet?

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:07.798
It was time.

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:12.302
The old condom ring in the leather
just doesn't say "cool" anymore.

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:16.140
Rachel, you just put an empty carton
back in the fridge.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.101
I know,
but the garbage was full.

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:22.312
Have you ever taken out the trash?

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:26.692
Well, I thought you liked doing it.

00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:33.323
- Third door on the left.
- Right!

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:44.710
Hey, Mr. Treeger.

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.105
What are you doing?

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:08.650
Um... Oh! Oh!

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.487
I'm sorry.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:13.489
It's a little old but...

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:18.285
You're clogging up the chute
I just unclogged.

00:01:18.536 --> 00:01:21.580
I'm sorry.
I don't come in here a lot.

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:25.501
Aw, of course not.
You're a little princess.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:28.420
Daddy, buy me a pizza.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.339
Daddy, buy me a candy factory.

00:01:30.548 --> 00:01:34.510
Daddy, make the cast of Cats
sing "Happy Birthday" to me.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:37.429
You think you can come here...

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.517
...make a mess and a big man
in coveralls will clean it up?

00:01:41.726 --> 00:01:44.812
Think of someone else for a change.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.651
Okay, I'm sorry.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:02:00.202
God, if you're going to cry about it!

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.715
- Whoa, whoa! Treeger made you cry?
- Yes.

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:59.720
He said really mean things
that were only partly true.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.723
I'll teach him a lesson.

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:05.475
Joey, don't.
Let's forget about it.

00:03:05.685 --> 00:03:09.605
That's easy for you to say.
You weren't almost just killed!

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:13.108
All right, that's it.
School is in session!

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:16.445
My God.

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:17.863
Is this a gym card?

00:03:18.072 --> 00:03:20.282
Oh, yeah, gym member.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.077
I try to go four times a week,
but I've missed...

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:25.746
...the last 1200 times.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.291
So why don't you quit?

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:32.002
You don't think I've tried?

00:03:34.464 --> 00:03:38.300
You think I like having $50 a month
taken from my account?

00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:41.720
They make you go
all the way down there.

00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:46.391
They use all these phrases
and peppiness to confuse you.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:48.727
And then they bring out Maria.

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:52.439
- Who is Maria?
- Oh, Maria!

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.609
You can't say no to her.

00:03:55.818 --> 00:03:59.613
She's like this lycra,
spandex-covered, gym treat.

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:04.409
Do you need me to go with you
and hold your hand?

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.579
- No.
- You're strong enough to face her?

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.790
Oh, no. You'll have to come.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.338
Tribbiani.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.840
Hold on. I'll get the plunger.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:25.013
Hey. You hold on.
You made my friend Rachel cry.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.349
So you'll go and apologize to her...

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.559
...unless you want me
to call the landlord.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:30.978
And tell him what?

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.689
Maybe you haven't heard of
"not making girls cry."

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:38.443
Maybe you haven't heard of the
Rent Stabilization Act of 1968.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.446
I have actually not heard of that.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.826
Your friends are violating it.

00:04:46.077 --> 00:04:49.579
I've been nice until now,
but I don't need this grief.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.373
I'm telling the landlord...

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:54.835
...Monica's illegally
subletting her grandmother's place.

00:04:55.044 --> 00:04:57.337
Your friends are out of here, pal.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.717
Why don't you tell me
something I don't know?

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:08.140
Somebody tell me
I don't have to work today.

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:09.599
What's the matter?

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:12.978
My first massage is
this incredibly gorgeous guy.

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:14.896
Every time I see him,
I want to...

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.524
...do things to him
I can't charge for.

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.696
So do them for free.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.907
No, it is forbidden.

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.621
No, no. Mrs. Potter fires people
for messing around with clients.

00:05:31.873 --> 00:05:34.333
And it's against my oath
as a masseuse.

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:36.209
They make you take one?

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:38.211
No, I made myself take one.

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.672
No fooling around with clients...

00:05:40.882 --> 00:05:43.258
...and, um, always be prepared.

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:50.098
That one's from the Boy Scouts,
but it just makes good sense.

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:53.769
Why not give him to someone else?

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.730
No, I can handle it.
I'm a professional.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.442
Pheebs, is that
a new ankle bracelet?

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:02.361
You got a pedicure.

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:04.071
Your feet are all dressed up.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:09.659
That's the only part he can see
when he's on the table!

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:13.872
You're going to do
some feet flirting!

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:17.334
I don't know what
you're talking about. Heh.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.796
How do you explain the toe ring?

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:27.135
It's Arabian Princess Day at work.
Leave me alone!

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.393
My hero! What happened?

00:06:35.603 --> 00:06:38.647
Well, I told him no one treats
my friends like that.

00:06:38.856 --> 00:06:40.857
And he better apologize.
See you!

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.651
Wait a minute.

00:06:43.361 --> 00:06:45.529
- What did he say?
- Uh...

00:06:45.696 --> 00:06:49.366
He wouldn't apologize, because
you're living here illegally.

00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:52.369
Instead, he'll evict you.
See you later!

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.831
- You got us evicted?
- I told you not to go down there.

00:06:56.124 --> 00:06:57.332
He made Rachel cry!

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.251
Rachel always cries!

00:07:00.503 --> 00:07:02.546
That's not true!

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.217
You go down there,
and you suck up to him.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.262
You suck like
you've never sucked before!

00:07:11.556 --> 00:07:13.640
All right, I'll try.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:16.852
If I can't, you stay with us
till you get settled.

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:19.229
- Go!
- All right, all right.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.065
I'll have to check first,
but he'll be cool.

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:31.408
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Remember what
we talked about. You got to be strong.

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.368
Yes, yes!

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:35.078
Now one more time.

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:37.539
Don't you want a washboard stomach...

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:38.874
...and rock-hard pecs?

00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:42.711
No, I want a flabby gut
and saggy man-breasts.

00:07:43.754 --> 00:07:45.881
- Good. That's good.
- Okay.

00:07:51.596 --> 00:07:53.096
I want to quit the gym.

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:55.223
You want to quit?

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:00.687
I want to quit the gym.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:05.484
You do realize you won't have
access to our new Swedish spa?

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:13.492
I want to quit the gym.

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:17.746
Dave in the Membership Office
handles quitters.

00:08:20.082 --> 00:08:22.417
Excuse me. Are you a member?

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:24.211
Me?

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.506
- No.
- Sorry. Members only.

00:08:30.468 --> 00:08:32.219
I want to quit the gym!

00:08:32.428 --> 00:08:35.013
It's okay, man. Be strong.

00:08:40.728 --> 00:08:43.855
So are you a member of any gym?

00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:47.776
No, and I'm not going to be.
So save your little speech.

00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:49.528
Okay, no problem.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:51.112
Could you come here?

00:08:54.158 --> 00:08:55.617
Hi, I'm Maria.

00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:57.494
Hi, M...

00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:12.968
Wow. You have really pretty feet.

00:09:14.679 --> 00:09:16.179
These old things? Ha.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:21.685
Would you spend time on my
sciatic area? It's killing me.

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:24.980
You mean...

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:27.649
By sciatic, you mean...

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.943
...the towel-covered portion?

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:31.194
Yeah.

00:09:31.821 --> 00:09:33.697
Sure, I can do that.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:37.576
Because, um, the muscles
in the sciatic area can get...

00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:40.203
...real nice and tight.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:48.962
Yeah. So, um, tell me, Rick,
how did you injure the area?

00:09:49.171 --> 00:09:51.840
A 16-hour sit-in for Greenpeace.

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:53.425
Oh.

00:10:01.809 --> 00:10:03.101
Ow!

00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:05.770
- Did you just bite me?
- No!

00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:15.238
What?

00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:18.867
Please don't kick the girls out.
This was my fault.

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:21.745
You want me to kick
you guys out instead?

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:25.415
You can't. Where would
the chick and the duck live?

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:29.252
- You have pets?
- No. No, no, no.

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.046
Those are, uh, nicknames.

00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:33.757
I'm the chick,
and Chandler's the duck.

00:10:34.216 --> 00:10:38.261
Huh. I would've thought
it was the other way around.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.640
Come on. Let the girls stay.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.558
I'll do whatever you want.

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:45.644
Really? You'd do anything?

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.145
Yeah, absolutely.

00:10:47.938 --> 00:10:50.398
- I got something.
- What is it?

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:55.445
Can you be my dancing partner?

00:10:58.282 --> 00:11:00.283
That's not prison lingo, is it?

00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:10.752
- His dancing partner?
- Yeah.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:14.381
There's this superintendents' dance,
"The Super Ball."

00:11:16.717 --> 00:11:20.512
He wants to impress Marge,
this lady super he likes.

00:11:20.721 --> 00:11:22.722
Why not practice with a girl?

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.015
He's too shy.

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:27.227
He's not good enough
to dance with girls yet.

00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:28.395
Yeah, right.

00:11:28.604 --> 00:11:32.941
He almost danced me right down
that garbage chute.

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:36.945
Would you let it go already?
You're fine.

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.201
- Hey.
- So did you quit?

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.036
No. I almost did.

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:48.665
Couldn't leave Ross there
without a spotter.

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:51.209
Wait, now, so you joined the gym?

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.132
And that's funny, why?

00:11:57.425 --> 00:11:59.300
Oh, ahem...

00:11:59.468 --> 00:12:03.805
I was just, you know,
picturing you working out, and...

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.141
Well, that's it.

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:09.144
We're doomed.

00:12:09.311 --> 00:12:13.773
They'll take $50 a month from our
accounts for the rest of our lives.

00:12:13.941 --> 00:12:14.983
What'll we do?

00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:18.069
You could actually go to the gym.

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:24.492
Or...

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.828
Or we could go to the bank...

00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:30.915
...close our accounts
and cut them off at the source.

00:12:32.334 --> 00:12:33.960
You're a genius.

00:12:34.211 --> 00:12:37.505
Oh, man! But then
we won't be bank buddies.

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:39.841
Now there's two reasons.

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.138
Hey.

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:49.517
You guys, remember that cute client
I told you about?

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:50.852
I bit him.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:55.774
- Where?
- On the tushy.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.193
And that's not against your oath?

00:12:59.195 --> 00:13:01.863
I know,
but the moment I touch him...

00:13:02.031 --> 00:13:06.242
...I want to throw out my old oath
and take a new, dirty one.

00:13:07.495 --> 00:13:10.163
Next time, try to distract yourself.

00:13:10.372 --> 00:13:12.874
Like when I'm doing
something exciting...

00:13:13.167 --> 00:13:16.044
...and I don't want to get too...

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:17.712
...excited.

00:13:17.963 --> 00:13:21.758
I try and think of other things.
Like, uh, sandwiches...

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.760
...and, uh, baseball...

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:27.388
...and, uh, Chandler.

00:13:29.391 --> 00:13:31.559
- Thank you.
- Oh, no, thank you.

00:13:38.859 --> 00:13:41.861
All right, I'm here.
Let's get this over with.

00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:44.113
Okay, uh, well...

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:46.241
...just follow my lead.

00:13:47.868 --> 00:13:51.371
Don't we need to do some kind
of preparation first?

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.706
Like get really drunk?

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:57.585
Come on. Hey, just put
your arms around me.

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:06.761
I'm sorry.

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:10.014
No. It's okay.
But if I'm Marge...

00:14:10.224 --> 00:14:12.225
...my breasts are coming out my back.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.603
Ah, forget it!
I'm not being any good at this.

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:18.064
My mom was right.

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:21.109
I'm just a big potato
with arms and legs and a head.

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:25.947
Come on, man.
You're not a potato.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.534
I'm sure as hell not a dancer.
It's no use.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.328
Marge will never go for me.

00:14:33.455 --> 00:14:35.957
Come on, Treeger.
Don't say that.

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:37.959
You just need more practice.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.378
Come on. Let's try it again.

00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:47.385
Plus, it was probably
mostly my fault anyway.

00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:50.889
I'm not that comfortable
dancing with a... Whee-hee!

00:14:52.224 --> 00:14:53.641
- Hey!
- Yeah.

00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:59.898
So how goes the dancing?
Gay yet?

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:05.987
Ha-ha-ha. You guys owe me bigtime.

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:12.368
What was that?

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:16.748
- What?
- You just did a little dancy thing.

00:15:16.957 --> 00:15:19.250
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:22.295
- You did a little hop.
- You are so enjoying this.

00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:23.838
No, I'm not.

00:15:24.089 --> 00:15:27.133
And it wasn't a hop.
It was a pas de bourrée.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:32.388
You know the words!

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.265
You are so into this!

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:38.895
Maybe I'm enjoying it a little.
I'm getting pretty good at it.

00:15:39.855 --> 00:15:44.150
This is so sweet.
Joey, our little twinkletoes.

00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:47.445
This isn't some kind of girly dance.

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:50.698
It's like a sport, it's manly.

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:53.826
- Show me some "manly" moves.
- All right.

00:15:57.873 --> 00:15:59.374
I don't know how to lead.

00:16:06.423 --> 00:16:08.049
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:10.385
We'd like to close our accounts.

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:13.137
Close your accounts?
Is there a problem?

00:16:14.098 --> 00:16:16.933
- No, no.
- No, we'd just like to close them.

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:18.226
Okay...

00:16:18.727 --> 00:16:21.020
Ms. Lambert handles all our closures.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.231
Would you come over here, please?

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:26.234
Hi, I'm Karen.

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.237
I want to quit the bank!

00:16:33.742 --> 00:16:35.576
Okay. Baseball.

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:39.455
Rick playing baseball.
He slides into second.

00:16:39.707 --> 00:16:42.083
Maybe even his pants
come down a little.

00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:43.751
Oh, no, wait! No.

00:16:44.003 --> 00:16:46.587
Okay, sandwiches.
Sandwiches. Um...

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:48.715
Okay, on a plate.

00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:51.759
Maybe Rick's pants come down a little.
No! No!

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.554
Chandler.

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:57.890
Okay, Chandler. Ooh, that's working!

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:08.067
Chandler's knees.

00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:11.404
Chandler's ankles.

00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:13.614
Chandler's ankle hair.

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:15.241
Oh, no!

00:17:16.285 --> 00:17:17.910
Okay, you're all set. Heh.

00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:20.621
Oh, wow! That was amazing!

00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:23.291
- Was that really just an hour?
- Yeah.

00:17:23.751 --> 00:17:26.586
In really long hour-world.

00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:27.920
What?

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:30.423
Ugh! Okay...

00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:33.801
I have an enormous crush on you.

00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:36.888
But since you're a client,
I can't ask you out...

00:17:37.139 --> 00:17:39.932
...even though you give me
the feelings.

00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:43.311
Wow. I had no idea.

00:17:43.937 --> 00:17:45.229
But, uh...

00:17:45.439 --> 00:17:47.523
I can always find another masseuse.

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:49.025
Really?

00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:51.235
Yeah, really.

00:17:56.533 --> 00:17:57.575
What?

00:17:57.785 --> 00:18:00.161
Suddenly I'm very aware I'm naked.

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:03.664
Quiet down.

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:09.837
Mr. Simon's been waiting...
Oh, my God!

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:11.547
Why wasn't I offered that?

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:14.592
I'd definitely pay more for that.

00:18:16.136 --> 00:18:19.764
We have rules here.
This is not that kind of place.

00:18:19.973 --> 00:18:22.809
I know, but this isn't
how it looks at all...

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:25.561
...because Rick is, um, my husband.

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.313
Oh, really?

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:29.690
You'd better tell his other wife.

00:18:29.858 --> 00:18:32.443
She called three times
asking where he is.

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:37.782
Yes, I will tell her.

00:18:40.577 --> 00:18:43.204
- So you didn't leave the bank?
- No.

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:47.208
And somehow we ended up
with a joint checking account.

00:18:48.585 --> 00:18:50.670
What will you ever use that for?

00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:53.381
To pay for the gym.

00:18:55.384 --> 00:18:56.592
Hey!

00:18:56.802 --> 00:18:58.803
So I had a great day.

00:18:59.012 --> 00:19:01.389
Rick and I hit it off.
We were making out.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.851
Then my boss walked in
and fired me for being a whore.

00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.102
What?

00:19:06.478 --> 00:19:08.146
- You got fired?
- Oh, my gosh!

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:12.233
It's so weird. I have never
been fired from anything.

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:14.068
Sweetie.

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:18.322
I started walking around,
not knowing what to do next.

00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:23.202
I started asking people on the street
if they wanted massages.

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:26.581
Then these policemen thought
I was a whore too.

00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:29.584
It's really been a bad day,
whore-wise.

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.425
Hey, Duck. Is Chick here?

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:43.055
Yeah, Bunny Rabbit.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.434
Ready for our last practice?

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:50.771
We're not getting that spin right,
because my place is small.

00:19:51.023 --> 00:19:54.442
- Want to use our place?
- No, I had another idea.

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:37.985
We did it!

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:40.321
That was incredible!

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:44.075
That was amazing!
We totally nailed it!

00:20:44.284 --> 00:20:47.245
Hey, listen.
Thanks a lot, Tribbiani. Heh.

00:20:47.788 --> 00:20:49.622
Oh, my God! Look at the time.

00:20:49.831 --> 00:20:51.916
I got to catch the bus to the ball.

00:20:52.459 --> 00:20:54.585
Oh! Okay...

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:56.462
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

00:20:56.713 --> 00:21:00.716
Unless you want to practice
the fox trot. Or the tango?

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.469
Aw, thanks, but no.

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:07.473
You see, I think I'm ready
to dance with girls.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:09.350
Okay, heh...

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:11.852
- Go get them, Treeger.
- Right.

00:21:16.275 --> 00:21:17.733
Hey, uh...

00:21:17.943 --> 00:21:19.860
You want to come?
Marge has a friend.

00:21:21.029 --> 00:21:22.113
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:24.991
You'd dance good with her.
She's the same size as me.

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:26.867
No, I'm good.

00:21:44.594 --> 00:21:47.388
You've got great experience.

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:49.890
Let's see.
Reason for leaving last job?

00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:51.892
They thought I was a whore.

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:57.273
Okay. We'll give you a call
if anything comes up.

00:21:58.734 --> 00:22:01.235
Great. Thank you very much.
