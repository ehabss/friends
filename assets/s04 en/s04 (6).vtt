WEBVTT

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:06.588
- Thanks for the tasty dinner.
- You're welcome for a tasty dinner.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.757
What are you guys looking at?

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.552
Ross and the most
beautiful girl in the world.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.595
Yeah, come to Papa!

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.436
I know!

00:00:22.522 --> 00:00:24.523
Probably the only time
I'll say this...

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.067
...but did you see the ass on her?

00:00:27.318 --> 00:00:29.570
What did you?
When did you?

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:32.740
How did you?
How did you get a girl like that?

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.245
So what is she, like a spokesmodel?
An aerobics instructor?

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:41.790
Actually, she's a paleontology
doctoral candidate...

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.168
...specializing in the Cenozoic Era.

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:47.046
But that's, like, the easiest era.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.341
I've seen her at work,
but I always figured...

00:00:53.762 --> 00:00:56.263
But, uh, I made her dinner.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.975
We had a great time.
And we're going out again tomorrow.

00:01:02.437 --> 00:01:06.356
Maybe her friends are betting to see
who gets the biggest geek.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:08.942
Fine by me. Hope she wins.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.159
Hey!

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.203
You have any wrapping paper?

00:02:01.412 --> 00:02:03.038
Is it for my birthday present?

00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:05.874
It was your birthday months ago.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:11.213
You said you ordered something special
and it just hadn't come yet.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:15.092
I have a call in about that.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.302
Oh. Okay.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.390
It's for Kathy. It's an early copy
of her favorite book.

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:24.101
Oh! The Velveteen Rabbit!

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:27.062
When the boy's love
makes the rabbit real...

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:30.691
Don't touch it, because
your fingers have destructive oils.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.778
Then you'd better keep it away
from Ross' hair.

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.241
This is pretty rare.
How did you get that?

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:42.077
No big deal.
I just went to some bookstores...

00:02:42.245 --> 00:02:46.582
...talked to some dealers, called
some of the author's grandchildren.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:48.500
Honey, that's so sweet.

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:53.422
What a great way to say, "I secretly
love you, roommate's girlfriend."

00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:56.091
It doesn't say that.

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.759
Does it?

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:02.723
How will it look when you get her
something incredibly meaningful...

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:06.935
...and expensive, and her boyfriend,
Joey, gives her an orange?

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.772
I'll make sure Joey gets her
something really great.

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:13.108
It's got to be better than that book.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.152
Ooh! Like a crossbow!

00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:19.114
Once again, I am sorry.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:21.116
Thank you. Bye.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:26.121
I had to turn down a job
catering a funeral for 60 people.

00:03:26.497 --> 00:03:29.291
Oh, my God! What happened?

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:31.460
Sixty guests.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:37.132
Why'd you have to turn it down?

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.635
I don't have the money or equipment...

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:43.305
...to handle something that big
on such short notice.

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:45.807
Wow, what is with all the negativity?

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.311
You sound like "Moni-can't,"
not "Moni-can"!

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:52.564
Moni-ca.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.569
You've been playing around
with this catering for years.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.405
- Do you want to be a caterer?
- I don't know.

00:04:00.657 --> 00:04:02.574
There you go! That's the spirit!

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:08.080
If you need money, I will lend
you money. Just get moving!

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:11.833
Really? I'd need $500
for all the food and supplies.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:16.672
It's worth it if it'll get you moving.
You haven't worked in months!

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:17.881
Neither have you.

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:20.509
Yes, but I'm doing this.

00:04:21.094 --> 00:04:23.220
That would be great! Thank you.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.306
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:29.810
Can I borrow your apartment keys?

00:04:29.978 --> 00:04:31.019
Why?

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:35.857
You can pee here.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:43.031
Ha-ha-ha. Yes, I can, of course.
Excuse me.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.368
It's okay.
The duck's using our bathroom anyway.

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:51.873
What are you getting
for her birthday?

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.710
We've been dating a couple weeks.
I got to get her something?

00:04:54.877 --> 00:04:56.003
Yes!

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.964
Yes! You have to get her
something really nice.

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.259
- I know!
- And not one of your coupons...

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:04.261
...for an hour of "Joey Love."

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:11.601
Ooh! A crossword! Can I help?

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:13.061
No!

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.605
Last week I got all
but three answers...

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:18.400
...and I want to finish one
without any help.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:19.818
Fine.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.739
But you can't help me develop
my new universal language.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.867
- Hey!
- How'd it go?

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:30.078
Oh, my God!
It was the best funeral ever!

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:32.914
Everyone loved the food.

00:05:33.124 --> 00:05:35.584
I even got another funeral
for tomorrow.

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:38.086
The dead guy from today's best friend.

00:05:38.463 --> 00:05:42.132
It's like I am the official caterer
for that accident.

00:05:42.383 --> 00:05:44.301
Mon, I'm so happy for you!

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.262
Thanks.
Check out my new catering stuff.

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:49.765
Look! I'm an omelet station!

00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.851
- Omelet? Made to order?
- Ha!

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.479
I'll have one, please.
Plus my money.

00:05:56.647 --> 00:05:58.023
Oh...

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:00.609
I didn't realize
you needed it right away.

00:06:00.818 --> 00:06:04.321
You told me to go and be a caterer.
So I went. I be'd.

00:06:05.907 --> 00:06:07.991
I used it to buy all this stuff.

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:11.620
I got another job tomorrow,
so I'll pay you back then.

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:15.123
Oh! Okay.
Sorry I acted like a bank.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.678
Um, would you like to come in?

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:33.183
Did Homo erectus hunt
with wooden tools?

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:36.603
According to recent findings.

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:50.242
Here, Mitzi! Here, Mitzi!

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:53.662
Uh, Mitzi is?

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.664
My hamster.

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.834
I hope she's okay.
I haven't seen her in a while.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:00.877
Have a seat.

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.462
Where?

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.674
Uh, oh! Do you, uh...?

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:13.223
Do you have any, um,
Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:16.017
- What?
- Well, I do.

00:07:17.395 --> 00:07:20.522
Let's go back to my place,
light a couple candles...

00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:24.526
...break open a box
of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:29.197
- I'd rather not.
- Oh, yeah? Why not?

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:33.034
Okay, um...
Don't take this the wrong way...

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:36.705
...but your place kind of
has a weird smell.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.215
- Is everything in the car?
- Did you settle the bill?

00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:49.718
No. I hate this part.

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:53.013
Ooh! Oh! Look what we almost left!

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:55.223
- That's not mine.
- Oh.

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:57.726
Ooh. Look what we almost took!

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:06.735
Excuse me, Ms. Burkart?

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:08.904
Well, we're all cleaned up.

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:12.532
Oh. Good. Thank you.

00:08:14.035 --> 00:08:15.535
Um, ahem...

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:19.915
And, well, there's
this small matter of the, um...

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.751
- Dear?
- The matter of...

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:25.170
...payment.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:30.091
Jack used to handle the finances.

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:44.272
You know what we should all do?

00:08:44.482 --> 00:08:46.608
Go see a musical.

00:08:49.153 --> 00:08:50.612
Sure.

00:08:51.864 --> 00:08:53.323
You know which one?

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.494
The 1996 Tony Award winner.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.331
Do you know the name of that one?

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:04.125
I don't know, um, Grease?

00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:07.170
No.

00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:10.340
Rent?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:12.634
Yes! Rent!

00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:15.095
So when do you want to go?

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:17.722
What? I'm sorry. I can't, I'm busy.

00:09:21.102 --> 00:09:22.978
Hey...

00:09:23.145 --> 00:09:27.566
Man, it is so hard to shop for girls. Ugh!

00:09:27.733 --> 00:09:30.819
Yes, it is, at Office Max!

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:34.406
What did you get her?

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:37.492
A pen.

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:42.914
It's two gifts in one.
It's a pen that's also a clock. Huh?

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:46.835
- Ha, ha. You can't give her that.
- Why not?

00:09:47.128 --> 00:09:48.336
She's not 11!

00:09:50.047 --> 00:09:52.674
And it's not the seventh night
of Chanukah.

00:09:55.261 --> 00:09:59.180
What he means by that is,
while this is a very nice gift...

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:02.017
...maybe it's not something
a boyfriend gives.

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:03.518
Sure, it is.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.020
She needs a pen for work.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:09.774
She's writing. She turns it over.
"Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"

00:10:11.861 --> 00:10:16.072
All right. What did you get
for Angela Del Veccio's birthday?

00:10:16.866 --> 00:10:18.366
She didn't have one.

00:10:18.909 --> 00:10:20.869
For three years?

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:26.207
Look, it's too late,
and I got an audition.

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:28.418
I can't shop anymore.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:33.381
I will go out
and try to find something for her.

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:35.216
Thanks, man.

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:38.553
While you're at it,
could you get her a card?

00:10:39.263 --> 00:10:42.432
Would you like me to write her
a little poem as well?

00:10:42.683 --> 00:10:46.061
Or just get a card
that has a poem already in it.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:52.233
- Oh! You have to get our money.
- She couldn't stop crying.

00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:55.945
With those thick glasses,
her tears look giant.

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.614
I know, it's tough.

00:10:57.907 --> 00:11:00.992
You know what the first thing I did
after my mom's funeral was?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.078
- What?
- Pay the caterer!

00:11:04.205 --> 00:11:05.580
I've had a lot of jobs.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.751
And there are some people
who always try to get out of paying.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.587
It's either "That massage
wasn't long enough"...

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.090
...or "I don't know
any of those songs"...

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:19.302
...or "These sombreros aren't
big enough. Bad little white girl!"

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:21.638
Okay.

00:11:21.806 --> 00:11:23.598
So you think she's faking?

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:27.435
There weren't any tears
till you showed her the bill.

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:29.604
She sounded pretty upset to me.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.440
You're a grand old flag

00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:36.736
You're a high-flying flag
And forever in peace may you wave

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:39.447
She seems fine now.

00:11:46.163 --> 00:11:49.332
So you just left?
Her place was really that bad?

00:11:49.542 --> 00:11:53.253
You throw your jacket on a chair
at the end of the day.

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:57.298
Like that, only instead of a chair,
it's a pile of garbage.

00:11:58.843 --> 00:12:01.886
And instead of a jacket,
it's a pile of garbage.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.766
And instead of the end of
the day, it's the end of time...

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:09.269
...and garbage is all
that has survived.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.815
- Here.
- Wow. Thanks.

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:16.192
So, uh, what happened?

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.695
Nothing. I had to get out of there.

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:21.322
Next time, you take her
to your place.

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:24.325
I tried that.
She says it has a weird smell.

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:28.830
- What kind of smell?
- I don't know. Soap?

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:31.791
- Listen, you like this girl, right?
- Yeah.

00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:33.918
- You want to see her again?
- Yeah.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.880
So you're going to have
to do it in the mess!

00:12:38.007 --> 00:12:40.675
Yeah, okay. You're right.

00:12:40.843 --> 00:12:44.345
I mean, uh, who cares about
a little sloppiness?

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:46.181
Yeah.

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:48.850
- It's endearing, really.
- All right!

00:12:49.101 --> 00:12:52.061
Now you go get that beautiful pig!

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:05.450
I just spent the entire
afternoon looking for a present...

00:13:05.701 --> 00:13:08.495
...for Kathy that would be
better than the rabbit.

00:13:08.662 --> 00:13:09.662
Any luck?

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:14.250
Yeah, I found this great place
called "Invisible Things for Kathy."

00:13:14.543 --> 00:13:17.378
Can you give me a hand
with all this stuff?

00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:21.216
Just return the book,
let Joey give her the clock pen...

00:13:21.425 --> 00:13:24.219
...and you get her
something worse than that...

00:13:24.428 --> 00:13:25.762
...like a regular pen.

00:13:27.056 --> 00:13:29.766
She's really going
to love this, you know?

00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:33.061
The bottom line is,
I want her to have it...

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:36.606
...even if I don't get to be
the one who gives it to her.

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:38.775
Aw, honey, that's so sweet.

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:42.237
Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?

00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:44.280
Oh, "pathetic"!

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:50.495
Hey! I've been looking
all over for you.

00:13:50.788 --> 00:13:53.998
- Where?
- Our place. The hall.

00:13:57.753 --> 00:13:58.920
I got something.

00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:07.679
It's a book.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:09.764
A book?

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:13.768
Is it a book that's also a safe?

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:18.022
It's a book that's just a book.

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:22.110
It's The Velveteen Rabbit.
It was her favorite as a kid.

00:14:22.319 --> 00:14:24.821
So, uh, just let me know
if she likes it, okay?

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.114
You got it.

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:28.616
Thanks for doing this. I owe you one.

00:14:32.288 --> 00:14:35.498
There wasn't any change
from that twenty, was there?

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:39.002
No, it came out to an even twenty.

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:43.798
Wow. That's almost
as much as a new book.

00:14:48.804 --> 00:14:51.097
Jeepers Creepers

00:14:51.265 --> 00:14:52.974
Where'd you get those peepers?

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:56.769
Jeepers Creepers
Where'd you get those eyes?

00:14:56.937 --> 00:14:57.937
You didn't get the money?

00:14:58.105 --> 00:15:00.648
Maybe I can try at intermission?

00:15:01.483 --> 00:15:03.318
You know what? Let's just go.

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:06.571
No! Hey!
We're not leaving till we get paid!

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:08.865
I don't know who she thinks she is.

00:15:09.199 --> 00:15:10.950
Enough is enough!

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:13.453
Hey, widow?

00:15:14.830 --> 00:15:17.790
Widow? Excuse me? Excuse me!

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:24.339
Thanks. Um, clearly this is
a very, very hard time for you.

00:15:24.548 --> 00:15:27.842
Um, but we provided a service,
and we deserve to be paid...

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.969
...because you ate that service.

00:15:30.179 --> 00:15:34.474
We are not leaving here until
we are paid every penny, because...

00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:38.853
...we're part-time caterers
and we have no place else to go.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:42.565
All right. I'll get my bag.

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:44.067
Good.

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:54.410
I'm going to leave some cards here.

00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:59.707
Please think of us
for your next event.

00:16:05.881 --> 00:16:07.382
You want to come inside?

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:09.759
Yes.

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:13.805
Yes, I do.

00:16:23.524 --> 00:16:26.275
I'll be right back.
Make yourself comfortable.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.636
- Guess who.
- Uh...

00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:56.347
Department of Sanitation?

00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:00.226
- It's me.
- Ha, oh!

00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:12.488
Aw!

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:14.490
What?

00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:17.493
- Oh, Cheryl!
- Oh, Ross!

00:17:18.787 --> 00:17:21.205
Oh! Oh!

00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:28.838
Oh! God!

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:32.508
Aah! Oh, my God!

00:17:36.638 --> 00:17:38.598
No! No!

00:17:39.016 --> 00:17:41.392
It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!

00:17:41.643 --> 00:17:45.313
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.
I must have freaked out.

00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:47.106
Thank God it's not Mitzi!

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:49.984
It's just a rat.

00:17:53.822 --> 00:17:55.490
I did it! Aah!

00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:58.743
I finished it! I did it all by myself!

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:00.870
And there's nobody to hug.

00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:03.790
Move!

00:18:09.296 --> 00:18:11.214
Hey! Hey, you guys!

00:18:11.507 --> 00:18:13.633
I finished it all by myself!
Hug me.

00:18:13.842 --> 00:18:15.426
Yay! So good!

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:18.221
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:19.639
How did it go?

00:18:19.848 --> 00:18:23.851
The widow wouldn't pay, so
Phoebe yelled at her till she did.

00:18:24.061 --> 00:18:26.229
I'm a hard-ass.

00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:31.526
And I'm a wuss.
We should be partners.

00:18:31.735 --> 00:18:34.529
Hard-ass and wuss.
We could fight crime.

00:18:36.698 --> 00:18:38.199
Wait a minute, Phoebe.

00:18:38.742 --> 00:18:40.409
We should be partners.

00:18:40.869 --> 00:18:42.745
We should be catering partners.

00:18:42.955 --> 00:18:46.707
You're not working now,
and we have a great time together.

00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:49.585
- Okay.
- I cook and you take care of the money.

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.963
Oh! It'll be like
I have a wife in the '50s!

00:18:57.427 --> 00:18:58.803
- Hey.
- Hey!

00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:00.721
How did she like the gift?

00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:03.808
She loved it.
She's showing the girls right now.

00:19:04.059 --> 00:19:05.226
Yeah? That's great.

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:06.769
I got to tell you...

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:09.897
...I feel bad taking credit
for this, because...

00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:12.150
...am I going to get
a lot of credit for this!

00:19:17.739 --> 00:19:18.781
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:19:18.949 --> 00:19:21.117
Hey. Happy birthday.

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:22.743
Thank you.

00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:25.246
You know, uh,
Chandler got you a gift too.

00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:28.082
No, he didn't.

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:33.337
Yeah, he did. Look,
it's right there on the counter. Ho, ho!

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:41.762
Happy birthday.

00:19:42.764 --> 00:19:44.015
I'm sorry.

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:48.269
You really didn't have to.

00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:51.272
- Wow!
- See...

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.818
You think it's just a pen, but you
turn it over and it's also a clock.

00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:58.779
Really? No, this is great!

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:02.033
- Thank you, Chandler.
- Oh. Yeah.

00:20:02.826 --> 00:20:04.118
Aw. Heh.

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:06.370
Want to go to bed?

00:20:07.289 --> 00:20:09.457
I'll be in, in a minute.

00:20:12.628 --> 00:20:16.130
Oh, uh... Don't forget your coupon.

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:23.471
Good night.

00:20:25.057 --> 00:20:27.475
Um, thank you for the gift.

00:20:27.851 --> 00:20:32.647
Oh, uh, I just knew that
sometimes when you're writing...

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:35.650
...you don't always
know the exact time.

00:20:36.652 --> 00:20:40.321
No, I didn't mean the pen.
Thank you for the book.

00:20:41.823 --> 00:20:42.907
Uh, the book?

00:20:43.158 --> 00:20:44.700
The Velveteen Rabbit?

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.828
I have a feeling you had
something to do with it.

00:20:48.038 --> 00:20:49.288
What do you mean?

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.832
When Joey gave it to me he said:

00:20:52.042 --> 00:20:56.587
"This is because I know you like rabbits,
and I know you like cheese."

00:20:59.341 --> 00:21:01.175
Thanks. I love it.

00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:03.386
I know how hard
it must have been for you to find.

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:09.684
In case you missed that,
that sound was, "Oh, well."

00:21:10.435 --> 00:21:13.729
You must really like Joey
to go to all that trouble.

00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:15.439
Oh, yeah. He's my...

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:22.697
He's my best friend.

00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:26.867
- Well...
- Good night.

00:21:36.211 --> 00:21:39.422
Hey, that coupon expires, you know.

00:21:50.058 --> 00:21:53.394
Hi, uh, you don't know me.
I'm Monica Geller, Ross' sister.

00:21:53.603 --> 00:21:56.856
You know, it's too bad
that didn't work out.

00:21:57.065 --> 00:21:59.400
Anyway, he told me
about your apartment.

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:02.570
Well, I couldn't sleep
thinking about it.

00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:07.825
So, uh, would it be okay
if I cleaned it?

00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:11.120
No?
