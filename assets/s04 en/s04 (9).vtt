WEBVTT

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.256
- Okay.
- Come on, no peeking.

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:11.343
Our eyes are closed, and we're about
to cross the street. Very good.

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.303
Okay. Open up.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:22.604
What do you want to show us?
Because all I can see is this bitchen van.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.774
Yeah, it's for our catering business.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:27.985
- Oh.
- I think I know that girl.

00:00:30.113 --> 00:00:33.699
- We're not gonna keep it this way, though.
- No?

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:36.910
We're gonna paint over the sword
and replace it with a baguette.

00:00:37.078 --> 00:00:38.746
Oh.

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:42.166
Um, also, we don't know what to do
with this.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:47.212
Oh, yeah, I definitely know her.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:41.308
Remember that guy from cooking school
that put cilantro in everything?

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:43.310
- Oh, sure, Cilantro Larry.
- Yeah.

00:01:44.145 --> 00:01:47.606
Well, I'm gonna fill in for him as food critic
for the Chelsea Reporter.

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:52.611
Wow. Monica, what an amazing opportunity
to influence...

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.321
...dozens of people.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.159
What about our catering business?

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:01.161
Oh, no, no, it's just one night a week.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.956
Plus, I get to take all of you out
for free dinners.

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:05.290
- Hey.
- Oh.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.542
Well, in that case:

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:13.006
- That was me hopping on board.
- Oh.

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:18.011
Hey, guys. Hey, Ross.
Quick question for you.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.680
Are you ready to party?

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:23.559
I don't know, I could maybe go out
for a couple of beers.

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:27.855
But there's this thing about bumblebees
on the Discovery Channel.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.235
No, no, no, I don't think you heard me.
Are you ready to party?

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:36.530
No.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.866
Gandalf? Gandalf is coming to town?

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:41.160
Kathy's with her parents,
I have nothing to do.

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:43.704
Tomorrow we are partying
with Gandalf, dude.

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:48.625
Dude, we are so gonna party. Yeah.

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:50.669
Wow, okay. Dude alert.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.173
And who is this guy?

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.594
Mike "Gandalf" Ganderson.
Only, like, the funnest guy in the world.

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.387
I'm gonna call
and get off work tomorrow.

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:03.724
Oh. I'm gonna call after you.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.852
This is gonna be so cool.
Dude, we never party anymore.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.271
Whoo!

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:13.275
All right, were you guys
smoking something in the back of our van?

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:17.613
What do you mean, we never have fun?
You have fun with me.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.909
Remember the time we saw those strippers
and you paid me 50 bucks to eat that book?

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:28.207
Joey, you are gonna love this guy.
Gandalf is like the party wizard.

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:32.002
- Well, why do you call him Gandalf?
- Gandalf the wizard.

00:03:34.088 --> 00:03:36.715
Hello? Didn't you read
Lord of the Rings in high school?

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:39.760
No, I had sex in high school.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:50.520
Oh. Uh, Joanna? I was wondering
if I could ask you something.

00:03:50.688 --> 00:03:53.398
There's an opening for an assistant buyer
in Junior Miss...

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.609
Okay, but that would be a step down
for me.

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.237
No, actually, I meant for me.

00:03:58.821 --> 00:04:00.948
The hiring committee
is meeting people all day and...

00:04:01.115 --> 00:04:06.119
Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but I guess
you can't stay my assistant forever.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:09.206
Neither can you, Sophie,
but for different reasons.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.126
I'm so glad
you don't have a problem with this.

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:15.629
If you did,
I wouldn't have considered applying.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:16.838
Really? In that case...

00:04:17.006 --> 00:04:19.216
And that's why I'm so glad
there's no problem.

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:23.845
Yeah, it's fine. I'm on the hiring committee,
so there'll be one friendly face.

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:25.430
Oh, that's great.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.183
- You know, Junior Miss is where I started.
- Really?

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.603
I had to sleep with the ugliest guy
to get that job.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.233
- Really?
- No. Ha, ha.

00:04:36.401 --> 00:04:37.985
Yeah.

00:04:38.987 --> 00:04:41.697
- I mean, no. No, no, no. Ha, ha.
- No. Ha, ha.

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:45.200
I'm sure with your qualifications,
you won't need to sleep with some guy.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.410
Oh. Ha, ha.

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:48.704
Although, uh,
I might need some convincing.

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:52.916
- Um... Oh.
- Kidding. Ha, ha.

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.254
- God, I feel wild today.
- Aah!

00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:05.679
Oh, man, I am so excited, I may vomit.

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:10.600
Will you calm down?
He's just a human guy.

00:05:11.102 --> 00:05:13.562
Look, you don't understand.
Gandalf is amazing.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.355
You never know what's gonna happen.

00:05:15.523 --> 00:05:19.985
You go out for a couple of beers and
end up on a fishing boat to Nova Scotia.

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.779
- Really?
- Oh, yeah, it's beautiful country up there.

00:05:23.573 --> 00:05:25.198
Hey. Okay.

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:30.203
I got my passport, fresh socks,
and a snakebite kit.

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:33.040
It's not gonna be exactly like last time.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:36.043
All right, I'll see you guys.

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.837
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:05:39.464 --> 00:05:41.882
I have an audition,
but I'll hook up with you later.

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.884
- Where you gonna be around noon?
- Heh.

00:05:44.052 --> 00:05:46.178
Somewhere maybe along the equator?

00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.848
Okay.

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.643
Hello?

00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:54.978
It's Gandalf.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:05:59.775
So are you in town?

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.445
Oh, well...

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.073
Well, maybe next time, then.

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:08.033
What happened?

00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:10.285
He's not gonna make it.
He's stuck in Chicago.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:11.787
Oh, man.

00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:14.623
Chicago's so lucky.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:19.294
Stupid, useless Canadian money.

00:06:24.842 --> 00:06:27.803
You have a very impressive résumé,
Ms. Green.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.307
I especially like what I see here
about implementing a new filing system.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:33.975
Thank you.

00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:38.105
Filing system? Oh, you mean those little
colored labels you put on all the folders?

00:06:38.272 --> 00:06:41.650
It certainly did brighten up
the inside of the filing cabinets.

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:46.279
Well, they, uh... They did more than that.

00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:50.492
I notice that you've been entrusted
with a lot of important responsibilities.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.163
Yes. Joanna really has been
an incredible mentor to me.

00:06:55.331 --> 00:06:59.126
Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible
at getting my morning bagel.

00:06:59.293 --> 00:07:01.920
It's amazing how she gets it right
almost every time.

00:07:03.423 --> 00:07:06.383
Of course,
I have more responsibilities than that.

00:07:06.551 --> 00:07:12.139
Oh, yes, of course. There's the coffee too.
Rachel can carry two things at once.

00:07:13.182 --> 00:07:15.642
That's, uh, very good.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.854
Now, a big part of this job...

00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:22.941
...is cultivating personal relationships,
especially with designers.

00:07:23.109 --> 00:07:25.652
- Yes, I realize...
- Rachel shouldn't have any problem.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.531
Her only problem might be getting a little
too friendly, if you know what I mean.

00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.409
I love working with designers.

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:35.704
With them, under them,
what's the difference, eh, Rach?

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.628
Hey. My first review is out.

00:07:43.796 --> 00:07:46.548
Oh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter.

00:07:46.716 --> 00:07:50.010
Ah. These used to keep me so warm.

00:07:50.678 --> 00:07:53.054
- All right, look, I'm on the back page.
- Ooh. Oh!

00:07:53.222 --> 00:07:57.434
Okay. "Would I go back to Allesandro's?
Sure, but I would have to order two meals.

00:07:57.602 --> 00:08:01.188
One for me, and one for the guy
pointing the gun to my head."

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.316
Wow, you really laid into this place.

00:08:04.484 --> 00:08:07.652
Hey, they don't pay me a penny a word
to make friends.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:11.323
Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy
who could fix up the van for catering.

00:08:11.491 --> 00:08:13.700
- Oh. You want me to go with you?
- No, no, it's okay.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:16.578
But are we sure
we don't want the waterbed?

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:20.290
- Haven't we made this decision?
- Yeah, all right.

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:23.543
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:30.884
Who is it?

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:33.845
It's Allesandro, from Allesandro's.

00:08:35.473 --> 00:08:36.515
Oh, my God.

00:08:36.682 --> 00:08:39.935
- I wanna talk to you about your review.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:42.312
Call me on the phone.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.357
What, so you can hang up on me?

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:48.276
I'm never gonna let you up,
so you may as well just go away.

00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:49.653
Just give me a chance to...

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.113
Do you need to get in? Here you go.

00:08:52.281 --> 00:08:54.324
- No, Phoebe!
- Oh, hey, Monica.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:04.543
I want a retraction.
Our food is not "inedible swill."

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.752
I couldn't eat it.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.422
I have five friends who couldn't eat it,
and one of them eats books.

00:09:10.758 --> 00:09:13.009
Well, our service is not
"grossly incompetent."

00:09:13.177 --> 00:09:16.304
The waiter carried the breadsticks
in his pants.

00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:21.351
Well, you said that we accept
the Discover Card...

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:23.937
...which we do not.

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.815
All right, that I'll retract.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:30.193
But I stand by my review.
I know food, and that wasn't it.

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.737
Your marinara sauce
tastes like tomato juice.

00:09:32.905 --> 00:09:35.865
You should serve it with vodka
and a piece of celery.

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:38.368
Hey, I'm proud of that sauce.
It's delicious.

00:09:38.536 --> 00:09:39.953
Oh, my God.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:42.914
You own an Italian restaurant
and you think that tastes good?

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.207
Where are you even from?

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:47.752
Lebanon.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:50.171
Hand me those tomatoes.

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:53.842
I'm gonna show you what it should
taste like. Come on, hand them to me.

00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:58.513
How long is this gonna take?
I got another critic I gotta go yell at.

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.814
Ahem. Uh, Joanna,
I wanna talk about that interview.

00:10:07.982 --> 00:10:10.233
I thought it went very well.

00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:15.864
No, it didn't.
That's what I wanna talk to you about.

00:10:16.782 --> 00:10:18.992
Now, just to brief you...

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.704
...I may cry.

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:27.626
But they are not tears of sadness
or of anger...

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:30.253
...but just of me having this discussion
with you.

00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:33.131
Rachel, please, don't make a scene.

00:10:33.799 --> 00:10:35.925
There's nobody here.

00:10:36.093 --> 00:10:37.927
Sophie, get in here.

00:10:40.014 --> 00:10:42.891
You see?
Now you're making Sophie uncomfortable.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.768
She's not making me uncomfortable.

00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:49.022
Congratulations, you've just crossed
the line into completely useless. Get out.

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:53.401
Do you want me to quit?

00:10:53.569 --> 00:10:55.654
What? What would make you think that?

00:10:56.739 --> 00:10:59.157
Well, all of those things you said
in the interview.

00:10:59.325 --> 00:11:02.452
If you believe any of them,
I must not be a very good assistant.

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:05.664
You know what?

00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:09.584
I am just going to pack up my desk...

00:11:10.878 --> 00:11:14.506
...and I will be gone
by the end of the day.

00:11:17.968 --> 00:11:21.680
Well, I guess there's no use me
sticking around till the end of the day.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:23.807
Wait, wait, wait.

00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:26.768
You can put your sad little muffin
back in its drawer.

00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:32.148
If you must know the truth,
I didn't wanna lose a good assistant.

00:11:32.483 --> 00:11:33.525
What?

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:38.363
That's why I said all those things
about your flirting and your drinking.

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.198
My drinking?

00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:44.244
Oh. I must have said that after you left.

00:11:45.579 --> 00:11:46.955
Said what, exactly?

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:48.915
That you enjoy the occasional drink...

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:50.917
...- ing binge.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:54.796
Oh, my God. Oh. That is it. I'm leaving.

00:11:54.964 --> 00:11:58.299
- You are just a horrible person.
- No, wait, wait, wait.

00:11:58.467 --> 00:12:01.386
Now, if you're gonna get
all sensitive about it.

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.929
I don't want to lose you.

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:05.640
What if I create a position for you?

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:08.810
I'll make you assistant buyer
in this department.

00:12:10.229 --> 00:12:12.731
- Say more things like that.
- Um...

00:12:13.524 --> 00:12:16.526
You can have your own office and a raise,
effective tomorrow.

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:19.904
- I'd need an expense account.
- Done.

00:12:20.448 --> 00:12:22.991
- And an assistant.
- Sophie, get in here.

00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:29.247
Now it seems like a lifetime, doesn't it?
Starting from...

00:12:29.415 --> 00:12:30.999
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.836
I thought you'd be partying
with Gandoldorf.

00:12:35.546 --> 00:12:38.673
It's Gandalf, and he's not coming.

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:42.177
- So you've been sitting here all morning?
- No.

00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:44.846
I balanced my checkbook.

00:12:45.431 --> 00:12:48.725
Yeah, and I gave first names
to all the foosball players.

00:12:50.519 --> 00:12:53.021
I can't believe he didn't come.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:56.483
So what if he didn't come?
We can still go out and party ourselves.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.320
Oh, no, you know, with Gandalf,
we'd be out all night.

00:13:00.488 --> 00:13:04.741
Yeah, we'd meet total strangers
and hang out with them.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:06.367
Well, we could do that.

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:10.288
There was other stuff too.

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.749
We'll do it all, and better.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:15.710
Look, after tonight,
Gandalf will wanna party with us, dude.

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:16.920
Come on.

00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:19.881
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:13:20.049 --> 00:13:23.468
- It's not like we don't know how to party.
- Yeah. All right. Let's go.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:25.595
And maybe we could end up
on a boat again?

00:13:25.763 --> 00:13:27.222
- Yeah!
- All right!

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:28.598
Ah!

00:13:29.099 --> 00:13:32.143
Hey, hey, hey. When were we on a boat?

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.103
Remember that really cold morning...

00:13:34.271 --> 00:13:36.940
...when you woke up
and those dogs were licking your face?

00:13:37.107 --> 00:13:38.775
- Yeah.
- Those were seals, man.

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:49.661
Hey, how do you think this suit would look
on an assistant buyer...?

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:51.955
The owner of Allesandro's
came to yell at me...

00:13:52.122 --> 00:13:55.333
...but I made him some sauce,
and he offered me the job as head chef.

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:56.543
Oh, my God.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:14:00.922
You just ruined the thing I was practicing
the whole way home, but I'm so happy.

00:14:01.799 --> 00:14:04.384
Can you believe it?
I finally get to run my own kitchen.

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:05.593
Oh, you've waited so long.

00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:07.804
- Ha, ha, oh.
- Oh.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:10.431
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs. Quick question for you.

00:14:10.599 --> 00:14:14.978
How do you think this suit would look
on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's?

00:14:15.145 --> 00:14:18.940
I don't know. It would totally depend
on her coloring and...

00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:20.984
- You got the job!
- Yes!

00:14:21.151 --> 00:14:24.028
Oh! You got the job?
Why didn't you tell me?

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:30.326
Oh. It's gonna be so great.
I'm gonna get to help decide what we sell.

00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:33.162
I'm gonna have an office
with walls and everything.

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:36.291
- I'm gonna have walls.
- Aw.

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:39.794
Is this the day of good news or what?
I got us a job.

00:14:39.962 --> 00:14:41.045
The wedding reception.

00:14:41.213 --> 00:14:42.672
Oh.

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:47.135
Um, Phoebe,
I kind of need to talk to you about that.

00:14:49.638 --> 00:14:50.805
Um...

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:55.727
Well, I think it might be time for me
to take a step back from the catering.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:58.646
- But we've only had one job.
- Tsk.

00:14:58.814 --> 00:15:03.568
I know, but now we have this second one,
and it just feels like it's snowballing.

00:15:04.862 --> 00:15:06.195
Yeah, what are you saying?

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:09.699
I got offered the head-chef job
at Allesandro's.

00:15:10.117 --> 00:15:14.370
- What?
- It's okay, you don't really need me.

00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:16.915
You're the cook.

00:15:17.708 --> 00:15:20.376
Without you,
it's just me driving up to people's houses...

00:15:20.544 --> 00:15:22.545
...with empty trays and asking for money.

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:27.508
All right.

00:15:27.676 --> 00:15:31.095
But, um, well, I'll pay you back
all the money you invested.

00:15:31.263 --> 00:15:34.390
- And you can keep the van.
- For what?

00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:39.437
I can't believe this.
I gotta get out of here.

00:15:39.605 --> 00:15:41.731
Phoebe, wait a minute.

00:15:44.985 --> 00:15:47.362
I'm an assistant buyer!

00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:55.411
All right, we'll get a little coffee,
get energized, then we'll head back out.

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:57.872
- Yeah, all right.
- Okay.

00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:05.046
So we're having fun, right?
We don't need that wizard guy.

00:16:05.214 --> 00:16:08.216
We hit a couple of clubs,
talked to some strangers...

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:11.928
...then after this, we'll go down
to the docks and see about that boat thing.

00:16:13.931 --> 00:16:16.182
I'm kind of beat.

00:16:16.642 --> 00:16:18.226
Actually...

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:19.894
...me too.

00:16:20.062 --> 00:16:21.062
Are you serious?

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:22.271
Yeah.

00:16:22.439 --> 00:16:24.190
Thank God. I'm exhausted.

00:16:26.694 --> 00:16:27.944
So you guys want coffees?

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:31.280
Yeah, but I don't wanna be up too late,
so I'll have a decaf.

00:16:31.448 --> 00:16:33.241
Yeah, me too.

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:36.828
Actually, could I get some hot water
with a little lemon?

00:16:37.538 --> 00:16:42.667
I strained my voice screaming in there.
Does it have to be so loud?

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.920
Oh. I can't hear a word you're saying,
my ears are ringing so bad.

00:16:46.088 --> 00:16:49.674
Huh. I was glad I brought that extra pair
of socks, you know?

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:50.925
I used them as mittens.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:53.011
I didn't wanna touch a thing
in that last place.

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.429
Oh.

00:16:58.392 --> 00:17:00.768
How sad are we?

00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:02.270
Yeah, I know.

00:17:03.355 --> 00:17:05.231
You know what? We're not sad.

00:17:05.399 --> 00:17:07.734
We're not sad,
we're just not 21 anymore, you know?

00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:09.402
I'm 29 years old, damn it.

00:17:09.570 --> 00:17:12.113
I wanna sit in a comfortable chair,
watch television...

00:17:12.281 --> 00:17:14.115
...and go to sleep at a reasonable hour.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:15.450
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:17:15.617 --> 00:17:19.287
Yeah, and I like to hang out in a quiet place
where I can talk to my friends.

00:17:19.455 --> 00:17:20.496
Yeah.

00:17:20.664 --> 00:17:25.501
And so what if I like to go home,
throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath?

00:17:29.256 --> 00:17:30.798
We're 29. We're not women.

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:41.684
Oh. There you are.

00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:44.937
Hey, I'm glad that you decided
to hear me out.

00:17:45.105 --> 00:17:47.190
Okay, I'm hearing.

00:17:47.858 --> 00:17:50.026
I've been doing a lot of thinking. A lot.

00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:55.198
And, well, I came up with a whole bunch of
businesses that you can do with your van.

00:17:55.365 --> 00:17:56.866
Okay, um...

00:17:57.409 --> 00:18:00.620
- You could be a flower delivery person.
- What?

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:02.914
Or a bakery delivery person.

00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:05.333
Pizza?

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.919
Monica.

00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:10.838
All right, I got a whole bunch of stuff
in this area...

00:18:11.006 --> 00:18:13.716
...but I'm getting the feeling
you don't wanna deliver.

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:17.929
- No.
- Okay.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.350
I'm guessing if you don't wanna deliver...

00:18:22.518 --> 00:18:25.603
...you probably don't wanna
pick up stuff either.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:27.313
No.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.819
You know what?

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:36.364
- Let's do the catering business.
- Really? Are you sure?

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:40.326
Yeah. You know,
I made a commitment to you.

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:43.538
- Know what? It'd be fun.
- Oh, it will be fun.

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:45.706
- Oh. Yay!
- Aw.

00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:48.918
Okay. Ooh, let's plan
the wedding reception. Okay.

00:18:52.965 --> 00:18:54.173
Wow.

00:18:56.093 --> 00:18:58.427
You really wanted me
to do something with this van.

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:06.018
You know what?
I want you to take the chefjob.

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:09.021
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:19:09.189 --> 00:19:11.315
That's what you really want.

00:19:11.483 --> 00:19:13.734
Yeah, I don't wanna be the reason
you're unhappy.

00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:15.194
That would make me unhappy.

00:19:15.362 --> 00:19:18.406
And I really don't wanna be the reason
I'm unhappy.

00:19:19.491 --> 00:19:21.159
Thank you.

00:19:23.662 --> 00:19:27.081
Besides, it might be kind of fun
to form the new A-Team.

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:39.093
Oh, hi, Mrs. Lynch. Is Joanna in already?

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:41.971
Oh, my goodness. You haven't heard.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:43.639
Heard what?

00:19:43.807 --> 00:19:46.976
Joanna passed away last night.

00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:49.812
Oh, my God. How?

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.899
Well, she was leaving work,
and she was hit by a cab.

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:55.943
Oh, my God. Oh, I cannot believe it.

00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:59.363
- I know.
- Oh, God.

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:04.619
Oh, God.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.997
I didn't realize that you were so close.

00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:11.751
Yes. So close.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:19.508
Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional
and difficult time for all of us.

00:20:19.676 --> 00:20:23.512
But by any chance, did Joanna
send any paperwork your way...

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.641
...before it happened?

00:20:26.808 --> 00:20:29.143
No, nothing.

00:20:29.311 --> 00:20:33.940
Imagine, if she'd just stepped off that curb
a few seconds later...

00:20:34.107 --> 00:20:39.070
Oh. Yes, yes, just a few seconds
and she'd still be with us.

00:20:39.238 --> 00:20:41.656
Nothing about an assistant buyer?

00:20:42.199 --> 00:20:44.533
I'm sorry. I have to go.

00:20:46.995 --> 00:20:47.995
Good morning.

00:20:48.163 --> 00:20:51.123
Oh, Sophie,
I guess you didn't hear about Joanna.

00:20:51.291 --> 00:20:52.792
I sure did.

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.842
I'm so excited about having Monica
come on board with us.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:05.846
Although I do feel bad
about having fired Chef Emilio.

00:21:06.014 --> 00:21:08.766
It is like losing a member of the family.

00:21:08.934 --> 00:21:13.104
Of course, that literally is the case
for several of you.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.358
Tony, Carlos, Marie...

00:21:17.526 --> 00:21:21.570
...please tell your father
how much we're going to miss him.

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:27.410
Now, I know that Monica
has a lot of great ideas for this place.

00:21:27.577 --> 00:21:30.496
Well, you all read the review. Ha, ha.

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:32.999
So without much further ado...

00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:37.295
...I present to you our new head chef.

00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:48.222
Um, I just wanna say, uh,
that with a pinch of excitement...

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.726
...a dash of hard work,
and a dollop of cooperation...

00:21:51.893 --> 00:21:53.853
...we can have the recipe...

00:21:58.317 --> 00:21:59.567
Are you going to kill me?
