00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.133
- What are you doing?
- I reorganized the fridge, heh.

00:00:09.384 --> 00:00:12.845
See?
Uh, bottom shelf, meats and dairy.

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:16.432
Middle shelf, fruits and vegetables.

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.936
And top shelf, expired products.

00:00:21.396 --> 00:00:24.982
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I am bored out of my mind.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.028
I've already been to the bank,
post office and dry cleaners.

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:32.489
Dude, you just described
seven days worth of stuff.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:36.618
Gotta spread it out a little, you know.
Haven't you ever been unemployed?

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.163
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.123
Hey, don't get religious on me, okay?

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:46.920
A guy in your position needs to be
a little better at relaxing, you know.

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:50.549
Why do you think we have
the comfortable chairs, huh? Here, sit down.

00:00:52.927 --> 00:00:54.053
Ready? Watch.

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.055
Aw!

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:57.306
And then...

00:00:57.474 --> 00:00:59.850
Aw, yeah! Huh?

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.478
- So, what? We just sit?
- Oh, no, no.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.147
We're not gonna just sit. Watch.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:07.775
Shh.

00:01:09.152 --> 00:01:10.611
Hello. Chandler Bing.

00:01:10.779 --> 00:01:12.321
Hello, Mr. Bing.

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:14.281
I love you.

00:01:14.991 --> 00:01:18.077
All right, whoever this is,
stop calling me.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.623
It's been six months! It's not funny!

00:01:23.291 --> 00:01:25.459
But I love you.

00:01:25.627 --> 00:01:28.504
Leave me alone!
For the love of God, leave me alone!

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:30.798
And that's Wednesday. Ah!

00:02:21.766 --> 00:02:23.100
Hey, you guys. Guess what?

00:02:27.355 --> 00:02:28.730
The British are coming?

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.526
Oh, you and your ways.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.407
Since it's Christmas, I'm gonna be
one of those people collecting donations.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:41.910
Yeah. I already have my bell,
and later on I get my bucket.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.162
Oh.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:46.123
Yeah, yeah.
I'll be spreading joy to the people.

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.834
Last year I spread a little joy,
but not enough.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.129
So this year, I'm gonna do the whole city.
Heh.

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.925
I knew a girl in high school
who did that. She was very popular.

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:01.805
Uh, so, Pheebs, where are you
doing your bell ringing?

00:03:01.973 --> 00:03:04.725
They gave me a great spot
right by Macy's.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:07.311
They never give such a good corner
to a rookie...

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:10.856
...but I'm the only one who can say
"Merry Christmas" in 25 languages.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.692
I lied.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.070
Oh, my God. Okay, you guys, here's Danny.

00:03:17.238 --> 00:03:19.573
Just watch this.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:25.537
See? Still pretending he's not interested.

00:03:27.916 --> 00:03:30.751
Okay, he's coming over.
Pretend we've forgotten who he is.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.462
- Hey, guys.
PHOEBE, CHANDLER &amp; MONICA: Hey, Danny.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.132
Oh, Danny! Hey!

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.342
Oh, uh...

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:43.013
Danny, you know Rachel. She's nice.
She's not bad to look at, right?

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:46.183
- Thanks, Mon.
- Of course.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.686
- Do you wanna go out on a date with her?
- Monica.

00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.898
Absolutely. Is Friday okay?

00:03:53.107 --> 00:03:54.524
Oh, my God.

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:56.902
Friday is perfect. She can't wait.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.948
On the date, I will be able
to talk to her directly, right?

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.408
See you Friday.

00:04:04.452 --> 00:04:08.330
Okay, what the hell was that?
You know what? Don't answer me.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:10.374
I have a date with Danny. Ha!

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:16.296
How could I not get the part?

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:20.175
The play was about a 29-year-old
Italian actor from Queens.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:23.387
Well, Talia Shire
suddenly became available.

00:04:23.554 --> 00:04:25.722
She's a woman!

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.767
What can I say? She nailed it.

00:04:30.061 --> 00:04:32.562
Uh, okay. Is there anything else?

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.649
Well, you're just gonna say no again, but...

00:04:35.817 --> 00:04:37.359
...gay porn?

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:41.863
Happy holidays!

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.202
And Merry Christmas.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.580
Oh, thank you, sir. Here's some joy.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.750
- Hey.
- How's it going?

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:54.960
Well, it's going okay.

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:58.380
- Oh, good. Here, let me help you out.
- Oh, thanks.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:04:59.756
- Yeah.
- Wow. Ha, ha.

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:04.970
Is that a new suede jacket?
It looks really expensive.

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.266
Yeah. I guess.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.644
Just get your nails done?

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.064
Yes, Phoebe,
but this is all I have, okay?

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.275
Okay, thanks. Happy holidays.

00:05:18.443 --> 00:05:20.569
- Here's your joy.
- Thank you.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:23.322
Thank you. Happy holidays and...
Wait.

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:27.200
- You can't take the money out.
- I'm making change for the bus.

00:05:27.368 --> 00:05:29.995
Can't you leave the dollar?
This money's for the poor.

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:32.497
I'm poor. I gotta take the bus.

00:05:33.207 --> 00:05:35.584
Okay. Seasons greetings and everything.
But still...

00:05:35.752 --> 00:05:36.960
Bite me, blondie!

00:05:37.128 --> 00:05:38.128
Oh!

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:44.176
Oh, I'm gonna give him
something besides joy. Just...

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:51.391
That part was perfect for me.
I can't believe I didn't get it.

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:53.643
I'm sorry, man.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:55.604
You know what you should do?

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:58.398
You should make something happen
for yourself.

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.817
You know, like write a play.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:04.613
Write a movie, huh? What about
those Good Will Hunting guys?

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:08.700
Come on, Ross. Be realistic, you know?
If I did write something...

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:12.412
...what are the chances I could
get those guys to star in it?

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.835
- Wait a second. I could star in it!
- Or that.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.799
I can't write, you know. I mean, I'm an actor.

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:27.719
I don't have the discipline
that it takes, you know. I can't do it.

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:29.596
I'll help you.

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:33.892
Yeah. I'll make up a schedule
and make sure you stick to it.

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.769
Plus it'll give me something to do.

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.147
- Really? You'd do that for me? Thanks.
- Yeah.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:42.609
We'll start off slow.
The only thing you have to do tonight...

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:45.153
...is come up with the name
of your main character.

00:06:45.822 --> 00:06:47.656
- Done.
- And it can't be Joey.

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:49.533
- It's not.
- Or Joseph.

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.201
Oh.

00:06:55.456 --> 00:06:57.666
Hi. What's up?

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.044
I just saw Danny getting on the subway
with a girl...

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.921
...and he had his arm around her.

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:04.506
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:07.008
Well, you should be. This is all your fault.

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:11.596
You meddled in our relationship.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.598
You had no relationship.

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:16.017
No, but I was doing my thing,
and everything...

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:18.603
...was going according to the plan!

00:07:18.771 --> 00:07:22.149
Oh, God. Stop with the plan.

00:07:22.316 --> 00:07:25.444
Unh. So what
if you saw him with a girl?

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.529
Who cares?
That doesn't mean anything.

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:31.616
You'll go out on a date with Danny and
be so charming he'll forget all about...

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:33.577
...that stupid subway girl.

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:36.913
She was kind of stupid.

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:41.293
You're right. All right.
I'm just gonna go on the date.

00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:45.589
I'm just gonna go on the date.
That is the new plan.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:48.800
Hurry, hurry!

00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:56.933
Mm.

00:08:03.774 --> 00:08:07.277
- Hey, how do you spell "suspicious"?
- Why?

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:11.281
Because I think this character
is gonna be suspicious about stuff.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.868
Yes!

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:18.955
Chandler Bing, seven,
Chandler Bing, zero.

00:08:19.123 --> 00:08:21.124
You're driving me crazy with that.

00:08:21.292 --> 00:08:23.084
- Okay, I'll stop.
- No, don't stop.

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:26.880
Move the bowl further away.
Ross could make that shot.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.805
Well, you suck. But at least
you suck at a man's game now.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.975
- You wanna play?
- I can't be playing games.

00:08:39.143 --> 00:08:43.188
Ross will be home soon. I have to write
five pages to stick to his schedule.

00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:47.234
Well, so play for the next 30 minutes,
then you can write until he gets home.

00:08:47.985 --> 00:08:49.528
All right.

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:53.073
But, listen,
what do you say we, uh...

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:54.991
...crank it up a notch?

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:56.326
I'm intrigued.

00:08:57.161 --> 00:09:00.413
All right. All we need
is a little lighter fluid.

00:09:00.581 --> 00:09:03.542
Okay, but be careful.
I wanna get our security deposit back.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:07.003
Yeah, I think we said goodbye to that
when we invented hammer darts.

00:09:08.422 --> 00:09:10.924
Do you remember which part
of the wall is not spackle?

00:09:11.092 --> 00:09:12.759
Uh, yeah, right here.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.640
Thank you. Happy holiday.

00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:24.104
No, that's trash, young lady.
No, you can't...

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:28.567
Hey. Stop that young lady!
She donated trash!

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.570
Hey.

00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:34.072
The charity's on fire!

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.616
Help! Good, thank you. I need that.

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:37.951
Whoo!

00:09:38.119 --> 00:09:42.163
What is this? It's 9:00 in the morning.

00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:46.251
All right. "A room.

00:09:46.419 --> 00:09:49.004
A man enters. He looks suspicious."

00:09:53.968 --> 00:09:55.552
That's it?

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:59.306
Joey, you were supposed to
have five pages done by now...

00:09:59.473 --> 00:10:01.683
...including an exciting incident.

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:08.315
What is all this?
"The Official Rulebook of Fireball."

00:10:09.442 --> 00:10:11.234
Yeah, that's the game we played.

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:14.487
Yeah, it's great. You take a
tennis ball, a bowl and lighter fl...

00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:16.323
Oh, oh.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:22.203
This is helping your career, huh?
You wanted to be an actor.

00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:25.498
Not the creator of
Crazy Lawsuit Game.

00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:28.293
You're right, you're right.
I'll get back to work.

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:32.047
And shame on you. You should know better.
Joey needs to work.

00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:34.257
- Now come on.
- Hey.

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:38.762
No, uh-uh. You can have this back
when the five pages are done, huh?

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:53.443
- I had a really nice time tonight.
- So did I.

00:10:53.611 --> 00:10:56.738
I'm really glad Monica asked us out.

00:11:05.373 --> 00:11:08.625
I'd love to ask you in
but my sister's visiting.

00:11:08.793 --> 00:11:11.961
- I think she's asleep on the couch.
- Your sister?

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:14.381
Your sister's asleep on the couch?

00:11:14.882 --> 00:11:18.677
Ah, I saw you with her on the subway
and now she's asleep on the couch.

00:11:18.844 --> 00:11:20.720
Oh, God!

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:24.307
- Oh, I thought I heard you.
- Oh, hey, great, you're up.

00:11:24.475 --> 00:11:26.559
Rachel, my sister Krista.
Krista, Rachel.

00:11:26.727 --> 00:11:28.061
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:31.106
Wish you told me we were having
company. I'd have fixed myself.

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:34.275
- Like it would help.
- You are so bad.

00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:35.694
- You are.
- You are.

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:38.238
- You are. You are.
- You are. You are!

00:11:38.406 --> 00:11:39.989
- You are so dead.
- Ha.

00:11:40.157 --> 00:11:42.784
- I'm gonna get you. Come here.
- Aah!

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.787
- Come here. Come here!
- Ha-ha-ha!

00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:52.502
Um, it's very nice to meet you.

00:11:57.091 --> 00:11:59.884
Nobody. Nobody respects the bucket.

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.721
You wouldn't believe
what people put in here.

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:04.597
Look. Okay, does this look like...

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:07.016
...a garbage can to you?
- No.

00:12:07.184 --> 00:12:09.436
- Does it look like an ashtray?
- No.

00:12:09.603 --> 00:12:10.854
Does it look like a urinal?

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:12.856
Ew!

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:17.861
- So, Pheebs, you gonna go back out there?
- Yeah, but I'm not gonna take any more crap.

00:12:18.028 --> 00:12:20.655
Okay? No more Mrs. Nice Bucket.

00:12:22.366 --> 00:12:25.160
Yeah, good for you. You're tough.
You lived on the street.

00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:27.954
Yeah, I'm gonna go back
to being Street Phoebe.

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:30.999
Yeah. Oh, but you know what?
I can't go totally back...

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.252
...because Street Phoebe really
wouldn't be friends with you guys.

00:12:37.047 --> 00:12:38.548
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:12:38.716 --> 00:12:40.592
- Um, can I ask you guys something?
- Sure.

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:45.430
Um, I don't have any brothers so I don't
know, but did you guys wrestle?

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.307
- Oh, yeah.
- All the time.

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:50.226
In fact, I was undefeated.

00:12:51.395 --> 00:12:53.688
Well, you weighed 200 pounds.

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:57.734
Still, I was quick as a cat.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:01.112
Well, I met Danny's sister yesterday.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.948
- Uh, that was the girl on the subway.
- Oh, you're kidding.

00:13:04.116 --> 00:13:07.410
And they were very, you know...

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:09.245
...wrestle-y.

00:13:09.413 --> 00:13:10.747
But I guess that's normal?

00:13:12.166 --> 00:13:13.708
We don't wrestle now.

00:13:15.961 --> 00:13:17.879
Not since I got
too strong for you. Ha, ha.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.758
- Too strong for me?
- Yeah.

00:13:21.926 --> 00:13:24.093
You wanna go right now?

00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:27.514
Because I'll take you right now, buddy.
You wanna go?

00:13:28.808 --> 00:13:29.933
Oh, fine.

00:13:32.186 --> 00:13:33.436
Ready?

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:35.939
Wrestle!

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.778
Okay, you know what, um?

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:44.864
Actually, that's great. That helps a lot.
Thanks.

00:13:49.453 --> 00:13:52.455
Guys, come on, let's go.
The puck drops in 20 minutes. Come on.

00:13:52.873 --> 00:13:57.001
- Joey's not going.
- I didn't finish my five pages.

00:13:58.003 --> 00:13:59.671
Why can't you finish them tomorrow?

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:02.465
Because tomorrow
he's redoing yesterday's pages.

00:14:02.633 --> 00:14:06.094
Yesterday's pages
did not reflect my best work.

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:10.723
Why don't you cut him a little slack?
Maybe if he relaxes, he'll get some work done.

00:14:10.891 --> 00:14:13.601
I think he's been relaxing enough,
thanks to you...

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:15.895
...and Fireball.

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:20.775
If you think Fireball's relaxing,
you obviously have never played.

00:14:21.944 --> 00:14:24.612
The only reason you're doing
this to Joey is you're bored.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.865
It's not his fault that you're unemployed.

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:29.659
I am not unemployed. I'm on sabbatical.

00:14:30.703 --> 00:14:32.370
Look, look. Guys, don't fight.

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:36.040
And the reason I'm doing this
is because I am Joey's friend.

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:39.210
And if you were a good friend,
you'd be doing the same thing.

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.671
So being a good friend
means acting like a jerk?

00:14:41.839 --> 00:14:44.424
If it does, then you're
an amazing friend of mine.

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:48.094
Hey, guys. How about we settle this
over a friendly game of Fireball, huh?

00:14:48.262 --> 00:14:52.348
- I'll go unhook the smoke detectors.
- How about we settle this right now?

00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:57.228
There. Now no one's going
to the game. Ha-ha-ha.

00:14:57.438 --> 00:14:59.480
- I paid for those tickets.
- No, you didn't.

00:14:59.648 --> 00:15:02.483
- You said you would, but you never did.
- Oh, yeah.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:12.452
So we finally get
to the top of the mountain, ahem...

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.496
...and airhead here forgets the camera.

00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:18.666
You know, that same thing
happened to me one time.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.670
When did that happen to you?

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:26.507
Don't you remember? We were jogging
in the park, we saw that pretty bird.

00:15:26.675 --> 00:15:29.427
And I wanted to take a picture
but I didn't have my camera.

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:33.056
Okay. First of all, chasing the churro guy
is not jogging.

00:15:34.725 --> 00:15:38.019
Oh, this is so good.
You have got to try it.

00:15:38.187 --> 00:15:42.440
Hmm. Mm.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:45.735
That is good.

00:15:49.031 --> 00:15:52.116
- Oh, damn. I got it on my pants.
- Here, I'll get it.

00:15:52.284 --> 00:15:53.326
Mm.

00:16:01.335 --> 00:16:03.586
We better take these off
or that stain will set.

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:07.006
- I wanna wear these pants on our date tonight.
- Oh, great.

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:10.677
Okay, bye. Oh, my God.

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:14.555
- That was unbelievable.
- Okay, see? I told you.

00:16:14.723 --> 00:16:18.101
- Yeah, wow. Sorry, Rach.
- I don't believe they're brother and sister.

00:16:18.268 --> 00:16:19.644
They're brother and sister?

00:16:32.282 --> 00:16:33.324
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:36.244
Wait a minute. Open your hand.
Let me take a look.

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:40.373
Quarter, dime. Lint?
Not interested in that.

00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:44.043
What's this? A Canadian coin?
Get out of here!

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:48.089
Gosh.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.550
Whoa. No drinks near the bucket.

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:53.553
Set it down over there
and then you can make a contribution.

00:16:54.972 --> 00:16:58.224
And you can leave the "hurt bunny"
look over there too.

00:16:59.143 --> 00:17:03.104
Hi, Bob.
I thought I told you to get out of here!

00:17:04.982 --> 00:17:06.733
Uh, Phoebe, we've been
getting complaints.

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.194
And we're gonna move you
to a less high-profile spot.

00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:11.446
What?

00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:15.950
- Uh, Ginger's gonna take over this corner.
- That chick can't handle my corner.

00:17:16.952 --> 00:17:19.620
Look, either you leave
or we remove you.

00:17:20.247 --> 00:17:21.789
Fine.

00:17:27.796 --> 00:17:30.798
All right, I'll give you one pointer.
Look out for that bitch.

00:17:41.143 --> 00:17:46.022
- Oh, hey, Rach. I thought we said 7.
- Yeah, uh, you know what? Uh, let's skip it.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.857
What? Uh, why?

00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:49.317
Um... Look.

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:52.570
You and your sister seem to have, um,
a very special bond...

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:56.324
Oh, great. That "special bond" again.

00:17:57.826 --> 00:18:01.662
Why do women have such a problem
with the fact that I'm close with my sister?

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.917
- Okay, look, I don't know, but...
- Do you have brothers?

00:18:06.085 --> 00:18:11.297
No, I have two sisters, but one of them
actually has a very masculine energy.

00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:15.176
- Are you close with them?
- No, no. They're not very nice people.

00:18:15.385 --> 00:18:17.887
Okay, come here. Listen.

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:20.890
I really like you, okay?
I think this could go somewhere.

00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:24.602
So what if I'm close to my family?
You gonna let that stand in the way of us?

00:18:25.521 --> 00:18:27.939
Well, I... I don't know...

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:30.149
See, when you put it that way, you know...

00:18:30.317 --> 00:18:33.820
Danny, hurry up. The bath's getting cold.

00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:39.408
- What?
- Yeah, okay, I'll see you later.

00:18:44.081 --> 00:18:46.999
Oh, hey. There's some kids
playing in the street.

00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:50.503
You wanna go down there,
give them a project, ruin their day?

00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:54.465
Hey, if they have a ball,
maybe you could stick razor blades in it...

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:57.718
...and teach them a new game:
"Gonna-Need-Stitches Ball."

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.475
Hey, guys. I was at the library all morning
and I already finished my five pages for today.

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:08.020
Great. Now we can go
to the Ranger game last night.

00:19:09.523 --> 00:19:12.650
No, dude. Ross tore up the tickets.

00:19:17.197 --> 00:19:21.909
I guess when you don't have so many
distractions, it's easier for you to focus, huh?

00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:26.497
Yeah, or also when you don't have somebody
breathing down your neck all the livelong day!

00:19:28.709 --> 00:19:33.045
Well, that's fine, but the important thing
is I finished it. And I think it's really good.

00:19:33.213 --> 00:19:37.300
But you know what would help me, is if
I could hear it. Would you guys read it for me?

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:40.845
- Yeah, all right.
- All right.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:45.850
Okay.
"It's a typical New York City apartment.

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:48.936
Two guys are hanging out." Ross?

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:55.818
- "Hey, man."
- "What is up?"

00:19:57.404 --> 00:20:01.240
"About yesterday.
I was really wrong. I am sorry."

00:20:01.408 --> 00:20:04.952
"No, it was me. I'm sorry.
I overreacted."

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:09.832
"Maybe it was both of us.
But we had our best friend's inter...

00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:16.839
But we had our best friend's
interest at heart."

00:20:17.174 --> 00:20:20.009
"Could I be more sorry?"

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:28.476
"I don't know. I am one sorry...

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:31.479
...polontologist."

00:20:34.942 --> 00:20:37.610
All right, Joey, we get it.

00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:39.862
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry too.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:43.866
Oh, no, no, no. Keep reading.
The good part's coming up. Keep going.

00:20:45.452 --> 00:20:48.246
"I am sorry, Chandler."

00:20:48.705 --> 00:20:50.915
"I am sorry, Ross."

00:20:52.501 --> 00:20:55.461
Ahem. "A handsome man enters."

00:20:56.255 --> 00:20:59.257
"Hey. How's it going, guys?

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:03.719
I don't know what you two are talking about,
but I'd just like to say thanks to both of you.

00:21:03.887 --> 00:21:06.555
You. You wouldn't let me
give up on myself.

00:21:06.723 --> 00:21:10.268
And you. Well, you co-created Fireball.

00:21:12.271 --> 00:21:13.896
The End." Yeah.

00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:17.358
This took you all day?

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:20.403
No, no, this only took five minutes.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:26.117
I spent the rest of the day coming up
with New Ultimate Fireball. Ha, ha!

00:21:31.498 --> 00:21:33.499
Okay. "It's a typical New York apartment.

00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:37.128
Two girls are just hanging out." Go.

00:21:37.879 --> 00:21:41.465
- "Hi, how are you doing, Kelly?"
- "I'm doing just fine.

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:44.385
God, Tiffany, you smell so great."

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.097
"It's my new perfume.

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:52.643
Why don't you come closer
where you can really appreciate it?"

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.149
- Oh, you know, Joey, you are sick.
- This is disgusting.

00:21:58.317 --> 00:22:00.109
I'm not reading this.

00:22:00.277 --> 00:22:04.488
What? Wait, wait, wait.
The handsome man was about to enter!
