WEBVTT

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.086
Is there any entertainment there?

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:08.841
All right. Here we go.
1999, the year of Joey.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.592
We're very happy for you.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.969
What's the matter?

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:15.806
We wanted to kiss at midnight, but
nobody else is going to so, you know...

00:00:15.974 --> 00:00:18.559
- All right, I'll take care of it.
- Oh, no.

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:20.185
Joey.

00:00:20.395 --> 00:00:22.980
- Thirty-three, 32, 31.
- Ross, Ross, Ross.

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:25.816
Listen, who are you kissing at midnight?
Rachel or Phoebe?

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.484
- What?
- Well, you gotta kiss someone.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:29.695
- Can't kiss your sister.
- Who's gonna kiss my sister?

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.989
- Chandler.
- Oh, man. Really?

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.158
Who would you rather have
kiss your sister?

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:35.743
- That's a good point.
- Yeah.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.371
Uh, well, since I have that whole history
with Rachel, I guess Phoebe.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.043
Okay, great. Pheebs, Pheebs. Listen.
Ross wants to kiss you at midnight.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.254
So obvious. Why doesn't he just ask?

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:50.090
Rach, Rach.
Listen, I'm going to kiss you at midnight.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.885
- What?
- You can't kiss Ross. You got the history.

00:00:53.053 --> 00:00:54.261
- So?
- So?

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.057
- Would you prefer me or Chandler?
- Oh, good point.

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:00.809
Three, two, one.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:03.228
Happy New Year!

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.861
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:12.738
- Happy New Year, Pheebs.
- You too.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.156
Happy New Year, Joey.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:16.492
So that do anything for you?

00:02:05.583 --> 00:02:06.708
You know what?

00:02:06.876 --> 00:02:11.046
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say, "No divorces in '99."

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.551
But your divorce isn't even final yet.

00:02:16.177 --> 00:02:18.303
Just the one divorce in '99.

00:02:19.973 --> 00:02:22.432
You know what?
I'm gonna be happy this year.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.726
I'm gonna make myself happy.

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:27.187
Do you want us to leave the room or?

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.317
Every day, I am going to do one thing
I have never done before.

00:02:32.485 --> 00:02:34.570
That, my friends,
is my New Year's resolution.

00:02:34.737 --> 00:02:36.947
- Ooh. That's a good one.
- Yeah?

00:02:37.115 --> 00:02:40.075
Mine is to pilot a commercial jet.

00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:43.829
That's a good one too. Now you
only have to find a planeload of people...

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.999
...whose resolution is
to plummet to their deaths.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:50.460
Maybe your resolution should be
not to make fun of your friends.

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:53.422
Especially the ones who may soon be
flying you to Europe for free...

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.507
...on their own plane.

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.844
She has a better chance of sprouting wings
and flying up your nose...

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.346
...than you do of not making fun of us.

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:05.767
In fact, I'll bet you 50 bucks you can't go
the whole year without making fun of us.

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:07.728
You know what? Better yet, a week.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.646
I'll take that bet, my friend.

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:12.065
And you know what?
Paying me the 50 bucks can be...

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.484
...the "new thing you do" that day.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.156
And it starts right now.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:23.785
All right, my New Year's resolution
is to learn how to play guitar.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.412
- Really? How come?
- Ah.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.249
You know those special skills
I have listed on my résumé?

00:03:29.417 --> 00:03:32.127
I would love it if one of those was true.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.214
Do you want me to teach you?
I'm a great teacher.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.090
Really? Who have you taught?

00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:39.843
Well, I taught me and I loved me.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:43.055
That'd be great. Yeah, thanks, Pheebs.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.349
Oh, look. Blaire forgot her glasses.

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.393
She's gonna be needing these
to keep an eye on that boyfriend.

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:51.772
Who, from what I hear,
needs to keep his stapler...

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.484
...in his desk drawer,
if you know what I'm talking about.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.404
Hey, Rach, maybe your resolution
should be to, um, gossip less.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:01.531
What? I don't gossip.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.536
Maybe sometimes I find out things.

00:04:06.704 --> 00:04:10.165
Or I hear something
and I pass that information on.

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.335
You know, kind of like a public service.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:16.797
Doesn't mean I'm a gossip. I mean,
would you call Ted Koppel a gossip?

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.967
Well, if Ted Koppel talked about his
coworkers' botched boob jobs...

00:04:20.134 --> 00:04:21.343
...yeah, I would.

00:04:21.761 --> 00:04:24.388
Well, they were like this.

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:32.396
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.940
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:36.733
I just asked that girl out.

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:38.610
- Nice.
- Nice. Yeah.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.446
Is that part of your resolution,
your "new thing" for today?

00:04:41.614 --> 00:04:43.699
Yes, it is. See?

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:45.867
"Elizabeth...

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:47.995
...Hornswoggle"?

00:04:49.205 --> 00:04:50.914
That's right.

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.793
Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

00:04:55.712 --> 00:04:58.672
Hornswoggle.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.009
You okay, Chandler? Is there something...?

00:05:02.176 --> 00:05:04.136
Something funny about that name?

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.889
No, no, I just think that maybe
I've heard it somewhere before.

00:05:10.852 --> 00:05:14.062
Oh, really? Where?

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:16.857
Somewhere funny I'll bet.

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:19.401
- Hey, Pheebs. Guess what?
- Hey.

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:24.031
Uh, I have a date
with, uh, Elizabeth Hornswoggle.

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:26.825
Hornswoggle?

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.202
Oh, this must be killing you.

00:05:29.787 --> 00:05:31.872
- All right, see you later.
- See you.

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:35.042
All right, Pheebs, I am ready
for my first lesson.

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:38.170
Okay. Oh, no, no,
you don't touch the guitar.

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:41.173
No, no. First you learn here,
then you learn here.

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.217
- Oh. Okay.
- Okay.

00:05:44.385 --> 00:05:48.013
- Okay. Lesson One: Chords.
- Ah.

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:51.975
Now, um, I don't know
the actual names of the chords, um...

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:57.397
But I made up names for the way
my hand looks while I'm doing them.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.902
So then, this is "Bear Claw."

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:05.655
Okay, "Turkey Leg"...

00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:08.950
...and "Old Lady."

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:14.206
What an interesting approach
to guitar instruction.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:20.170
You know, some might find it amusing.
I myself find it regular.

00:06:23.925 --> 00:06:25.008
Hey, everybody.

00:06:25.176 --> 00:06:27.928
Rachel was so good today.
She didn't gossip at all.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:30.764
I didn't. Even when I found out, um...

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:33.934
All right, let's just say I found out
something about someone...

00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:35.685
...and let's just say...

00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:37.729
...she's gonna keep it.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.942
Hey, Pheebs. Check this out.

00:06:45.405 --> 00:06:49.199
Ooh. You nailed the Old Lady. Oh!

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.034
Oh, ha, ha!

00:06:54.288 --> 00:06:56.164
Hey, listen,
I thought I was getting better...

00:06:56.332 --> 00:06:59.000
...so on my way home today
I stopped by this guitar store...

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:02.587
Did you touch any of the guitars
while you were there?

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.048
Did you?

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:08.802
No.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:12.013
Give me your hands.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.349
Strings.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.060
Pick.

00:07:19.313 --> 00:07:21.606
Do you want to learn to play guitar?

00:07:21.983 --> 00:07:24.109
- Yes.
- Then don't touch one!

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:28.321
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:07:28.489 --> 00:07:30.198
- Hi, Ben.
- Auntie Monica.

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:31.908
Aw.

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.411
Ross is wearing leather pants.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:42.377
Does nobody else see
that Ross is wearing leather pants?

00:07:42.837 --> 00:07:45.505
Someone comment on the pants.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.469
- I think they're very nice.
- I really like them a lot.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.306
Not what I had in mind.

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:57.976
See, people like Ross
don't generally wear these types of pants.

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:00.437
You see, they're very tight.

00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:03.565
Maybe there's something in that area?

00:08:04.108 --> 00:08:06.776
- I think they look really good.
- I like them.

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:09.654
Yeah, where did you get them?

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.781
See, I needed a new thing for today.

00:08:11.949 --> 00:08:15.535
And there's this leather store I go by
that always smells so good.

00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:19.372
And I thought to myself,
"Wow. You know, I've never owned...

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:24.127
...a really good-smelling
pair of pants before."

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:28.465
Oh, come on.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.012
Okay, seriously. What do you think?

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.473
- You look like a freak. Yeah, awful.
- Awful.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.895
Hey. What are you doing?
What are you doing?

00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.440
- It's my New Year's resolution.
- To blind my child?

00:08:46.317 --> 00:08:48.401
No, to take more pictures
of all of us together.

00:08:48.569 --> 00:08:51.321
I really think it's the best resolution.
Everyone can enjoy them.

00:08:51.489 --> 00:08:53.323
Well, everyone will enjoy my music
as well.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.006
My God, these pants. I'm burning up.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:16.221
Oh, God. She wants to snuggle now?
What, is she trying to kill me?

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.932
It's like a volcano in here.

00:09:20.351 --> 00:09:23.436
- Are you hot?
- No.

00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:26.523
Okay, it must just be me then.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.372
That was just the pants and the couch.

00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:47.085
Um, hey, do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

00:09:47.253 --> 00:09:49.754
- Oh, go ahead.
- Thanks.

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:29.085
Ah.

00:10:29.754 --> 00:10:31.713
Hey, my favorite part's coming up.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.548
Okay.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.233
Oh, my God!

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:58.239
Tiger. Dragon.

00:10:58.407 --> 00:10:59.949
Iceberg.

00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:03.578
Joseph, did you even study
at all last night?

00:11:03.746 --> 00:11:06.498
- Yes. Yes, I did.
- Then do Iceberg.

00:11:07.875 --> 00:11:10.752
- G-sharp.
- G-sharp?

00:11:12.129 --> 00:11:14.881
Have you been studying
the real names of the chords?

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.425
Have you?

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:20.303
Oh, my God.

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:22.555
What? I didn't touch a guitar.

00:11:22.723 --> 00:11:24.432
No, but you're questioning my method.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.852
No, I'm not questioning it, Phoebe.
I'm saying it's stupid.

00:11:28.646 --> 00:11:30.021
What?

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.525
Thank you.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.486
You know, none of my other student...

00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:39.155
...thought I was stupid.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:42.617
Your other student was you!

00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:47.914
Yeah, well, you know,
maybe you just need to try a little harder.

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:49.833
Maybe I need to try a real teacher.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.877
Right here. Here. Andy Cooper.
He teaches guitar.

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:55.338
And look.
Ooh, there's a picture of him with a kid.

00:11:55.506 --> 00:11:58.049
Yeah, and the kid's got a guitar!

00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:03.972
Fine. You go learn from
your qualified instructor.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.558
But don't come crying to me
when everyone is sick and tired...

00:12:06.726 --> 00:12:09.811
...of hearing you play
"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown."

00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.606
Baddest man in the whole damn town

00:12:13.774 --> 00:12:16.234
Oh, fine. Take his side.

00:12:19.613 --> 00:12:20.905
Hmm.

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:24.951
I can't wait to be with you.

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:27.287
I'll sneak over as soon as Ross
picks up Ben.

00:12:27.455 --> 00:12:29.998
I'll tell Rachel I'm gonna be
doing laundry for a couple hours.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:33.293
Laundry. Huh.
Is that my new nickname?

00:12:35.463 --> 00:12:37.005
Aw.

00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.841
You know what your nickname is,
Mr. Big...

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:55.732
- Hello?
- Joey, it's Ross. I need some help.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.942
Uh, Chandler's not here.

00:12:58.152 --> 00:12:59.652
Well, you can help me.

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:02.822
- Okay.
- Listen.

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.949
I'm in Elizabeth's bathroom.

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:06.785
Nice.

00:13:07.661 --> 00:13:11.164
No, I got really hot in my leather pants
so I took them off.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:14.459
But they must have shrunk
from the sweat or something.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:17.921
Or my legs expanded from the heat.

00:13:18.088 --> 00:13:22.675
I can't get them back on, Joey. I can't.

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:26.054
Oh. That is quite a situation.

00:13:28.599 --> 00:13:30.642
Uh, do you see any, like, powder?

00:13:31.435 --> 00:13:33.728
Powder. Yeah, yeah, I have powder.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.313
Good, good. Okay.

00:13:35.481 --> 00:13:37.899
Sprinkle some on your legs.
It'll absorb moisture.

00:13:38.067 --> 00:13:39.734
Then you can get your pants back on.

00:13:39.902 --> 00:13:41.945
Yeah, hold on.

00:14:04.134 --> 00:14:06.678
They're not coming on, man.

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:10.348
Um, you see any...? Oh, Vaseline?

00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.020
I see lotion. I have lotion.
Will that work?

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:19.649
- Yeah, sure, throw some of that on there.
- Hold on.

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:35.582
Ross, you okay?

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.585
They're still not coming on, man.

00:14:38.752 --> 00:14:42.130
And the lotion and the powder
have made a paste.

00:14:43.257 --> 00:14:44.716
Really?

00:14:45.718 --> 00:14:47.510
Uh, what color is it?

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:51.306
What difference does that make?

00:14:51.473 --> 00:14:55.435
Well, if the paste matches the pants,
you can make yourself paste pants...

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.687
...and she won't know the difference.

00:14:58.981 --> 00:15:00.231
Joey, do you have a minute?

00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:01.858
Dude, what am I...?

00:15:02.026 --> 00:15:05.069
Rachel's here, so good luck, man.
Let me know how it works out.

00:15:07.114 --> 00:15:10.325
Oh, Joey, I have such a problem.

00:15:10.492 --> 00:15:12.160
Oh, well, your timing couldn't be better.

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:15.038
I'm putting out fires all over the place.

00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:19.918
Okay, okay.
Joey, I have got to tell you something.

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.252
What is it? What is it?

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.631
Oh, my God. It's so huge. But you have to
promise me, you cannot tell anyone.

00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:28.134
- No, no, no. I don't want to know.
- What?

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.803
Yes, yes, yes. You do want to know.
This is unbelievable.

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:34.724
I don't care, Rach. Look, I'm tired of being
the guy who knows all the secrets...

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:36.059
...and can't tell anyone.

00:15:36.226 --> 00:15:37.769
You know secrets? What are they?

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.604
And you're not supposed
to be gossiping.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.482
No, I know, I can't keep this in.
So I pick up the phone...

00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:50.907
I'm not listening to you.

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:07.757
Ross? Um...

00:16:07.925 --> 00:16:10.259
You've been in there for a long time.

00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:13.096
I'm starting to get kind of freaked out.

00:16:13.263 --> 00:16:15.974
All right, I'm coming out.

00:16:17.017 --> 00:16:19.894
Hey, can you turn the lights off?

00:16:21.981 --> 00:16:25.733
No. Let's just leave the lights on.

00:16:35.786 --> 00:16:37.704
Oh, my God.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.540
I had a problem.

00:16:46.338 --> 00:16:47.380
Hey, Pheebs.

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:51.843
Oh, I can't talk to you. I don't have
a fancy ad in the yellow pages.

00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:54.762
Look...

00:16:55.305 --> 00:16:56.931
Pheebs, I just...

00:16:57.099 --> 00:17:01.728
I want to apologize for saying
your method was stupid.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.566
And maybe, ask you
to be my teacher again?

00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:10.445
And I promise, I won't touch a guitar
until you say I'm ready.

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:21.956
- You really think I'm ready?
- Uh-huh.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.334
Wow, cool.

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:27.795
Okay.

00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:48.441
- Was the chord at least right before...?
- No.

00:17:56.283 --> 00:17:58.326
Oh, my God.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.538
We heard about your pants. I'm so sorry.

00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:05.458
This year was supposed to be great.

00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:08.544
Well, it's only the second day,
and I'm a loser...

00:18:08.712 --> 00:18:12.465
...with stupid leather pants
that don't even fit.

00:18:13.675 --> 00:18:16.302
You're not a loser.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:18.429
Look at me.

00:18:24.728 --> 00:18:27.313
Hey, look. Look, Ross.

00:18:27.481 --> 00:18:29.440
Ben drew a picture of you.

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:31.984
Huh? You're a cowboy.

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:36.155
Oh.

00:18:36.698 --> 00:18:38.616
Because of the leather pants?

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:43.287
Ben doesn't think you're a loser.
He thinks you're a cowboy.

00:18:43.455 --> 00:18:44.705
I mean, that's something.

00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:47.917
- It really is something.
- Howdy, partner. Hey.

00:18:49.628 --> 00:18:51.712
Maybe I should get another pair.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.215
Ooh, you know, they had some...

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:58.261
...with fringe all down the sides.

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.723
I'm gonna go kiss Ben good night.

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.188
I can't believe he thinks I'm a cowboy.

00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.567
I would make a good cowboy.

00:19:18.282 --> 00:19:21.659
Okay, now that everything's wrapped up
here, I'm gonna go do my laundry.

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:24.787
Yeah, me too.
You know, if this shirt is dirty. Yep.

00:19:31.044 --> 00:19:33.212
Okay, I'm gonna go to.

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:36.132
I'm gonna go to the airport.
If I hang around there long enough...

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.343
...someone's bound to leave
one of those planes unattended.

00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:42.138
- Good luck, honey.
- Bye.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:49.937
Hey, uh, Joey, remember that big thing
I was going to tell you about?

00:19:54.067 --> 00:19:57.236
I'm not gonna tell you.
But if you found out on your own...

00:19:57.404 --> 00:20:00.364
...that would be okay,
and then we could talk about it, right?

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:04.285
Well, then it wouldn't be a secret.
So, yeah, that would be okay. Yeah, yeah.

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.495
Yeah.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.917
Hey, Joe, would you mind going over
into Chandler's bedroom...

00:20:11.084 --> 00:20:14.253
...and getting that book back
that he borrowed from me?

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:19.800
Now? You want me
to go over there now?

00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:21.344
Yeah.

00:20:22.346 --> 00:20:24.680
- Do you know something?
- Do you know something?

00:20:25.933 --> 00:20:28.476
- I might know something.
- I might too something too.

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:31.604
- What's the thing you know?
- You tell me what you know.

00:20:31.772 --> 00:20:33.231
- I can't tell you.
- Then I can't.

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:35.024
Okay, fine.

00:20:43.116 --> 00:20:45.284
You don't know.

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:49.163
How about I go there and walk into
Chandler's bedroom and see the thing...

00:20:49.331 --> 00:20:52.208
...that I think I know is actually
the thing I think I know.

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.877
- You know.
- And you know.

00:20:55.045 --> 00:20:56.128
Yeah, I know.

00:20:56.296 --> 00:20:59.215
Chandler and Monica?
Oh, this is unbelievable.

00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:01.968
- How long have you known?
- Too long. Oh, my God.

00:21:02.135 --> 00:21:05.054
Rach, I've been dying to talk
to someone about this for so long.

00:21:05.222 --> 00:21:09.225
Listen, listen. You can't say anything
to anybody. They're so weird about that.

00:21:09.393 --> 00:21:12.895
- Listen. Hey, Phoebe.
- Hey.

00:21:13.063 --> 00:21:16.691
It's raining. I don't like to fly
in the rain so...

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:22.905
Oh, I am going to go for a walk
in the rain. Ha, ha.

00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:24.240
Oh, yeah, me too.

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.413
That's weird.

00:21:30.872 --> 00:21:32.790
I bet they're doing it.

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:42.758
Oh, good. Okay, look. I can't
take it anymore. I can't take it anymore.

00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:45.011
So you win. Okay? Here.

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:48.180
Pheebs? Flying a jet?
Better make it a spaceship...

00:21:48.348 --> 00:21:50.641
...so you can get back
to your home planet.

00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:55.855
And Ross. Phone call for you today.
Tom Jones. He wants his pants back.

00:21:57.232 --> 00:22:01.027
And Hornswoggle? What, are you dating
a character from Fraggle Rock?
