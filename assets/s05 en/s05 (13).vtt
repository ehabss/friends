WEBVTT

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.339
Ah, I can't believe we've never
done this. It's so good!

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:10.092
It's so good for Monica.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.722
Time's up! My turn.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.351
- That was half an hour?
- It's your timer.

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.563
- Okay.
- All right.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:27.234
I don't like to brag about it,
but I give the best massages.

00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:30.320
All right, then massage me up
right nice!

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.242
Aah! Aah! Aah.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.952
It's so good, isn't it?

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:39.413
I don't know what I did to deserve it.

00:00:41.458 --> 00:00:43.125
Say goodbye to sore muscles!

00:00:43.418 --> 00:00:45.335
Goodbye, muscles!

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.430
She gives the worst massages ever.

00:01:39.724 --> 00:01:42.976
It was like she was torturing me
for information.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:46.855
I wanted to give it up.
I just didn't know what it was!

00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.651
If it hurts that bad, you should tell her.

00:01:50.902 --> 00:01:53.654
For the first time,
I'm in a real relationship.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:57.032
I won't screw that up by telling the truth.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:00.702
Dude, look out!

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.579
You almost crushed my hat.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:04.414
Sorry.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:07.376
And the bunny got away.

00:02:15.718 --> 00:02:19.138
This would be the place
where you explain the hat.

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:21.181
Oh. Yeah.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.808
There's this play, right?

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:27.020
I'm up for the part of this
cool, suave, international guy.

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.106
A clothes horse, so I figure...

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:33.902
...everyone at the audition will
wear ultra-hip, high fashion stuff.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.904
And you'll make them disappear?

00:02:37.157 --> 00:02:40.367
Like you could find something
this sophisticated.

00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:43.245
Done!

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:48.750
If you want to look good,
come to the store. I'll help you.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:50.419
- Thanks!
- Sure.

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:52.171
Please, take those off!

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.426
Hey, Pheebs. How's it going?

00:02:57.594 --> 00:03:01.680
Um, only okay. Because I just
got back from the hospital.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:03.724
Are you all right?

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:06.935
I'm fine.
But, uh, my grandma sort of died.

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:10.647
- Pheebs, sorry.
- It's okay.

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:12.858
She had a really incredible life.

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.153
It's not like I won't see her again.
She'll visit.

00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:21.408
Maybe she's with us right now.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:26.538
Right. She's on a new spiritual plane
and she'll come to the coffeehouse.

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:30.250
I just saw two people having sex
in a car right outside!

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.672
Uh, Pheebs' grandmother just died.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.134
Oh, my God! I'm so sorry.

00:03:39.636 --> 00:03:42.721
Actually, it's kind of cool.
Because it's like...

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:45.807
...you know, one life ends
and another begins.

00:03:47.518 --> 00:03:49.770
Not the way they're doing it.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:54.358
What happened? How did she die?

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.692
We were in the market...

00:03:55.944 --> 00:04:00.614
...and she bent down to get some yogurt
and never came back up again.

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.158
I'm so sorry.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.327
The last thing she said was:

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:10.457
"You get the eggs, I'll get the yogurt,
and we'll meet at the checkout counter."

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.167
You know what?

00:04:12.543 --> 00:04:15.003
We will meet at the checkout counter.

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:25.597
Since you're returning all this stuff...

00:04:25.848 --> 00:04:27.933
...you'll have to wear underwear.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.895
All right.
You'd better show me that too.

00:04:33.523 --> 00:04:35.649
It's missing something.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:39.069
Oh, I know. Um, okay.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:45.033
Really? A purse?

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:48.161
It's not a purse. It's a shoulder bag.

00:04:48.871 --> 00:04:50.872
- It looks like a woman's purse.
- No.

00:04:51.582 --> 00:04:55.669
Trust me, all the men are carrying
them in the spring catalog.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.547
See, look. Men carrying the bag.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.134
See, look. Women carrying the bag.

00:05:09.517 --> 00:05:14.646
But it is odd how a woman's purse
looks so good on me, a man.

00:05:16.107 --> 00:05:18.150
Exactly. Unisex!

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:21.528
Maybe you need sex.
I had sex a couple days ago.

00:05:23.072 --> 00:05:26.616
No, Joey. U-N-I sex.

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.704
I ain't going to say no to that!

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:40.964
- Who is it?
- It's Phoebe.

00:05:41.215 --> 00:05:42.632
Oh, great!

00:05:43.468 --> 00:05:45.302
Oh, you.

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:47.304
Um, what's up?

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:52.851
Um, well, I sort of have some bad news.
Can I come in?

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.395
Um, no, thanks.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.065
Um...

00:05:58.232 --> 00:06:03.153
- Well, um, Grandma died today.
- Wow!

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.448
Didn't she die like five years ago?

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.076
No, she just died today.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.788
Um, we're having
a memorial service tomorrow.

00:06:12.997 --> 00:06:15.707
Okay, I know I went to that already.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.459
No, you didn't!

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.252
Then who's been dead?

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:20.670
Lots of people!

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:25.300
Look, are you coming or not?

00:06:25.843 --> 00:06:27.010
Um, no.

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:32.349
I thought she was dead,
so I've made my peace.

00:06:34.018 --> 00:06:35.811
Plus I'm going to a concert.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:39.564
I'd invite you,
but, um, I only have two tickets left.

00:06:41.192 --> 00:06:45.570
- Fine. Okay, enjoy your concert.
- Thanks. Enjoy your funeral!

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.158
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:06:57.333 --> 00:07:00.210
You look just like your son,
Mrs. Tribbiani.

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:04.423
What?
Are you referring to my man's bag?

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:09.386
I thought it just looked good,
but it's practical too.

00:07:09.804 --> 00:07:11.638
It's got compartments for all your stuff.

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:15.016
- Your wallet, keys, address book...
- Your makeup.

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.855
What are you doing?
The audition's tomorrow.

00:07:20.106 --> 00:07:22.649
Yeah, but sandwich time is right now.

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.069
You get mustard on that bag,
you can't return it.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:29.114
Why would I return this?
I love this bag!

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:32.617
- All right, then you owe me $350.
- Fine.

00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:36.163
Do you take Vasa or Mooster Card?

00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:38.123
Joey...

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:43.587
Relax, I'll pay you with the money
from the job I'll get. Thanks to you.

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.465
What's the part? Auntie Mame?

00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.301
Don't listen to them. I think it's sexy.

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:51.887
You-and-I sexy?

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:01.980
Hello, Mrs. Pinilla.
Thank you for coming.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:04.274
Here's your, um, 3-D glasses.

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.613
Reverend Pong will say
when to put them on.

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.576
Hi, sweetie.

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:16.828
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.

00:08:17.205 --> 00:08:19.623
Hey, Pheebs. I'm so sorry.

00:08:21.459 --> 00:08:24.878
You know what?
My grandma had the exact same bag!

00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:27.005
I brought you flowers.

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:28.757
Oh, thanks!

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:31.927
Pulling flowers out
makes the bag look masculine.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.224
Excuse me, is this the, uh, memorial?

00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:39.017
Welcome.

00:08:39.393 --> 00:08:40.894
Here's your 3-D glasses.

00:08:41.395 --> 00:08:42.771
All right.

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:46.775
So how did you know Frances?

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.611
Actually, I hadn't seen her for years.

00:08:49.904 --> 00:08:54.616
But, um, I was pretty tight
with her and her daughter.

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:55.992
What's your name?

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.953
Frank Buffay.

00:09:00.706 --> 00:09:04.334
You know what? Strike that.
My name, uh, actually, is Joe.

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:07.295
Um, uh, Joe, uh, Hill.

00:09:07.588 --> 00:09:10.966
- You're Frank Buf...
- Shh. No! Joe Hill.

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.343
You just said...

00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:16.388
I got to go.
Thank you so much for coming.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.224
But...

00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:21.726
Oh, my God!

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:23.103
What happened?

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:24.688
That was my dad.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:27.482
- Oh, my God! What?
- Check it out!

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:30.527
It's like it's coming right at me.

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:41.288
- Did you catch him?
- What did he say?

00:09:41.539 --> 00:09:44.708
He said, um, "Nice to meet you, Glenda."

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:48.128
I couldn't give him my real name.

00:09:48.379 --> 00:09:49.462
Why not?

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.172
You saw the way he ran.

00:09:51.382 --> 00:09:54.175
You think he'd talk
to the daughter he abandoned?

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:56.136
What did you say to him?

00:09:56.387 --> 00:10:00.599
I said I was the executor of the will
and I needed to talk to him.

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.685
I'm going to meet him
at the coffeehouse.

00:10:03.894 --> 00:10:05.604
Could everyone take their seats?

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.481
I just can't think about that now.

00:10:08.899 --> 00:10:11.776
- I want to say goodbye to my grandma.
- Okay.

00:10:11.986 --> 00:10:13.278
Let's go say goodbye.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.960
I'm off to my audition. How do I look?

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.922
Great!
That bag will get you that part.

00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:34.758
And a date with a man.

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:40.847
You know what? Make fun all you want.
This is a great bag.

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:43.725
And it's as handy as it is becoming.

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:48.146
Just because you don't understand
something, doesn't make it wrong.

00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:51.524
You guys have to get used
to the fact that Joey...

00:10:52.276 --> 00:10:54.027
...comes with a bag!

00:10:55.905 --> 00:10:57.906
I've got to meet my dad.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.908
Will you tell him who you are?

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:02.744
Not at first.
I don't want to freak him out.

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:04.871
But aren't you pissed at him?

00:11:05.122 --> 00:11:07.082
This guy abandoned you.

00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:11.586
If it were me, this guy would be
in some serious physical danger.

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:16.549
I'd walk in there, I'd be like, "Yo, Dad!

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:20.011
You and me, outside. Right now!"

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:22.764
I kind of scared myself.

00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:26.059
Well, at least you scared someone.

00:11:27.937 --> 00:11:29.854
You'd think I'd be angry.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:34.192
You'd think I'd want to rip
his tiny little head off!

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:37.320
Fortunately, I'm past it.

00:11:37.822 --> 00:11:41.491
You do seem a little tense.
Here, let me help you.

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.868
Oh, get off! Ow!

00:11:44.036 --> 00:11:47.038
Stop it!
Why are you doing that to me?

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.040
What are you talking about?

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:52.085
As a masseuse and a human...

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.755
...I'm begging you,
never do that to anyone.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.508
I give good massages.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:03.805
I gave them to Rachel
before she got allergic.

00:12:06.475 --> 00:12:09.227
And Chandler, he loves them!
Watch.

00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:13.356
He does not like it. He's in pain!

00:12:13.607 --> 00:12:16.317
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is!

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:20.280
- What?
- I'm sorry but, ow!

00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:26.119
You've been lying to me?

00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:28.079
I can't believe that.

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:30.331
Maybe he didn't want to hurt you.

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.835
But the minute we start
to lie to each other...

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.214
And by "we"...

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:40.550
...I mean society.

00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:45.847
Anytime you're ready.

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:48.475
Ahem, well, you must be new here.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:51.019
Maybe we get a table,
I buy you a drink.

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.521
Could you try it without the purse?

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:57.192
Yeah, sure.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:04.783
Ahem, well, you must be new here.
Maybe we sit...

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:08.036
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure. What?

00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:10.872
Well, first, it's not a purse.

00:13:11.624 --> 00:13:12.707
Okay...

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:13.917
Anytime.

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:16.628
If you think
it's a woman's bag, it's not.

00:13:16.879 --> 00:13:18.797
It's a man's bag.

00:13:19.673 --> 00:13:22.258
Okay. And go.

00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:25.970
Let me show you the catalog.

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:27.722
Look. See?

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:30.683
Huh? It's the latest thing.

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:33.812
Everyone's got one.
Men, women, children.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.396
Do you sell these?

00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:40.777
No, these babies sell themselves.

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:43.696
Thank you. That was great.

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:45.740
But I didn't read anything.

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:48.117
I think we've seen enough.

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:51.454
All right, I'll see you.

00:13:51.705 --> 00:13:53.498
We got it. We got it.

00:13:56.043 --> 00:13:58.253
- Is Rachel here?
- No.

00:13:58.671 --> 00:14:03.424
Listen, I just wanted to apologize
about the whole massage thing.

00:14:04.134 --> 00:14:06.177
I really like them.

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:08.930
Please stop.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:12.183
We're supposed to be honest.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.104
I wish you could tell me,
"I don't like your massages."

00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:23.319
I don't like your massages.

00:14:25.406 --> 00:14:27.866
See? It's no big deal.

00:14:29.034 --> 00:14:30.869
But now you're crying.

00:14:31.078 --> 00:14:35.248
I'm not crying about that.
I'm crying about something at work.

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:39.586
My boyfriend said
he didn't like my massages.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:42.797
You don't have
to be best at everything.

00:14:43.048 --> 00:14:46.676
Oh, my God!
You don't know me at all!

00:14:48.429 --> 00:14:49.721
Okay...

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:52.473
You give the worst massages
in the world.

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:54.767
I'm crying here!

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:56.686
Look, hear me out.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.231
You give the best bad massages.

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:04.193
If anybody was looking
for the best bad massage...

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:06.696
...and they thought, "Who's the best?"

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.406
They'd have to go to you.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.369
Huh.

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:17.790
So you're saying that
if there was an award...

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.587
...for the best bad massage...
Who would get that?

00:15:22.838 --> 00:15:24.464
It would be you!

00:15:24.673 --> 00:15:27.842
You, Monica!
And you'd get all the votes.

00:15:29.011 --> 00:15:31.429
So they could call the award,
"The Monica"?

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:34.807
Absolutely.

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:37.018
Okay...

00:15:38.145 --> 00:15:39.646
I suck!

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:48.196
Thank you for meeting me.

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:49.822
Thank you.

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:51.950
Come sit.

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:55.495
Sit.

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:57.372
Sit!

00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:02.210
Um, alrighty.
Um, before we get started, I need you...

00:16:02.461 --> 00:16:06.631
...to state for the record
that you are, in fact, Frank Buffay.

00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:08.841
Yes, I am. Mm-hm.

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:13.513
- Okay.
- So, what did Frances leave me?

00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:16.557
- Huh?
- That's why you wanted me to come.

00:16:16.767 --> 00:16:18.101
Oh, yes.

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:21.145
Yes, she did. She left you, um...

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.524
...this lipstick.

00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:27.318
Oh. Huh.

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:31.572
Oh, it's, ew, used.

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:35.326
Uh, cool.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.167
I have just a few questions to ask,
so I'll get out my official forms.

00:16:46.672 --> 00:16:48.589
So question one:

00:16:49.299 --> 00:16:53.136
You were married to Frances'
daughter, Lilly. Correct?

00:16:53.387 --> 00:16:55.388
Yes, I was.

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:58.933
Okay, um, question two:
Um, did that marriage end...

00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:00.768
...A, happily...

00:17:01.061 --> 00:17:03.312
...B, medium...

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:06.733
...or, C, in the total abandonment...

00:17:06.984 --> 00:17:09.027
...of her and her two children?

00:17:09.903 --> 00:17:11.112
It really says that?

00:17:11.363 --> 00:17:12.447
Yeah, see?

00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:16.826
I guess then I would have to say C.

00:17:18.495 --> 00:17:20.121
Total abandonment.

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:23.416
Reasons for abandonment:

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:27.003
Um, A, top secret government work...

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:28.713
...B, amnesia...

00:17:28.964 --> 00:17:32.258
...or, C, you're just a selfish,
irresponsible...

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:34.886
...bad, bad man.

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:37.889
I don't want the lipstick that much.

00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:42.935
Would you do me a favor?

00:17:43.187 --> 00:17:44.896
Would you give Lilly...

00:17:45.856 --> 00:17:47.774
...that, please?
- What?

00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:50.193
When you see Lilly, give her that note.

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:52.862
I wanted to talk to her
at the memorial...

00:17:53.363 --> 00:17:58.117
...but I pictured her getting mad
the way you did, and I chickened out.

00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:01.329
I wrote her a note.
Give it to her, please?

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.165
But you came to see Lilly?

00:18:05.209 --> 00:18:06.250
Yeah. Why?

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:09.170
Lilly's dead.

00:18:10.714 --> 00:18:11.839
She what?

00:18:12.216 --> 00:18:13.257
She's dead.

00:18:13.884 --> 00:18:14.967
Are you sure?

00:18:15.135 --> 00:18:18.262
If she isn't, cremating her
was a big mistake.

00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:22.517
I can't believe this.
I just can't believe...

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.520
How? Oh, my God.

00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:27.355
How long ago?

00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:29.190
Seventeen years ago.

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:30.942
Oh.

00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:33.945
What about the girls?

00:18:36.865 --> 00:18:40.701
Well, Ursula is a waitress
and she lives in Soho.

00:18:42.621 --> 00:18:44.413
And Phoebe...

00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:47.959
...is on this couch.

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:59.387
Yep, lipstick and a daughter.
Big day for you.

00:19:00.681 --> 00:19:03.474
Phoebe, I, um...

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:05.143
Whoops.

00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:09.272
It's just, I don't know what to say.

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:15.403
I just can't believe that you're
my daughter. You're so pretty.

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:19.448
Yes, well, that's neither here nor there.

00:19:21.743 --> 00:19:24.537
Would it make you feel
better if I said...

00:19:24.788 --> 00:19:28.374
...that I was very, very sorry I left?

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:33.963
It doesn't matter what you say.
It won't make a difference.

00:19:34.214 --> 00:19:35.673
So you can just go.

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:42.471
Well, you know, in my defense,
I was a lousy father.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:45.433
- That's your defense?
- Yes, it is.

00:19:45.684 --> 00:19:49.687
I burned the formula,
and I put your diapers on backwards.

00:19:49.938 --> 00:19:54.483
I made up a song to sing to you,
but that made you cry even more.

00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:56.569
You make up songs?

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.906
Well, no, just that one.
But it was stupid.

00:20:00.157 --> 00:20:02.950
Let's see, how did it go? Um...

00:20:04.369 --> 00:20:07.371
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

00:20:07.998 --> 00:20:10.791
Why won't you go to sleep?

00:20:11.376 --> 00:20:14.086
Sleepy girl, sleepy girl

00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:16.464
You're keeping me up

00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:37.443
I'm not very good at this.

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:42.031
Well, I am.

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:48.704
Not yet. No.

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:55.419
Hey.

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:57.421
Hey! How'd the audition go?

00:20:57.839 --> 00:20:59.257
Estelle said I didn't get it.

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:02.718
What? Why?
Joey, you were so ready for it.

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:04.345
I thought so too...

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:07.223
...but the casting people
had problems with me.

00:21:07.474 --> 00:21:08.641
What kind of problem?

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:11.560
To tell you the truth...

00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:14.021
...they had a problem with the bag!
- Oh, my God!

00:21:15.565 --> 00:21:18.109
You know what?
It was a stupid play anyway.

00:21:19.069 --> 00:21:20.820
It's time to give up the bag.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.614
I don't want to give up the bag.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.617
I don't have to give it up, do I, Rach?

00:21:30.038 --> 00:21:32.456
You think I should give up the bag!

00:21:32.749 --> 00:21:37.169
Joey, I'm sorry.
As terrific as I think you are with it...

00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:44.051
...I just don't know if the world
is ready for you and your bag.

00:21:46.555 --> 00:21:48.139
I can't believe this!

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.559
Wait, I'm not saying
you shouldn't have a bag.

00:21:52.811 --> 00:21:56.981
There are other bags
that are maybe a little less...

00:21:57.774 --> 00:21:59.275
...controversial.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.987
Yeah, um, they're called wallets.
