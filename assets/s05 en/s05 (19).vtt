WEBVTT

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.044
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:06.755
Wow, you look nice.
What's the occasion?

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:09.508
Monica and I are celebrating
our 10-month anniversary.

00:00:09.676 --> 00:00:11.593
- Got reservations at Jean-George.
- Wow.

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:13.178
- How'd you get in?
- Oh.

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:15.472
Made a few calls,
pulled some strings...

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.475
...and they'll seat us if we both
have chicken and don't get dessert.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.773
- Hi, Chandler.
- Hey, Caitlin.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.150
Somebody got a haircut.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.777
Ugh. I hate it. I look like
an 8-year-old boy.

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.447
If that was true, gym class
would've been more interesting.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.619
- It's, uh, $27 even.
- Oh, okay. Here you go.

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:40.080
Where's the chicken?

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:43.125
Oh, it's in the back.
The duck pissed him off.

00:00:43.293 --> 00:00:44.793
He said that eggs came first.

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.088
- Ha, ha, thanks. I'll see you later.
- Okay. Bye.

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:53.802
What the hell was that?

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.013
- What?
- The flirting.

00:00:56.264 --> 00:00:59.725
Aren't you supposed to be going out
with, hmm, let's see, my sister?

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:01.769
I was not flirting.

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:05.189
It was totally flirting!
"Somebody got a haircut..."

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:11.653
First of all, the impression? Uncanny.

00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:16.325
Second, that wasn't flirting. That was just
casual conversation between two people.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.160
Oh! Yeah, right.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.621
You wanna see flirting?
I'll show you flirting.

00:01:21.706 --> 00:01:23.749
I'm good. I'm okay.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.511
I am so proud of Joey.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.805
- He's gonna be on Law and Order!
- I know.

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:23.809
But don't you think it should
be called Order and Law?

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.311
No, because they arrest the guy
and then try him.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:28.230
Yeah. Don't get me started on that.

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:33.193
- I was not flirting.
- And on your anniversary. For shame!

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:34.945
What's going on?

00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.406
Chandler was hitting on
the hot delivery girl.

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:40.826
I was not. And oh, God! Shh!

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:44.788
I'm sorry, but you were. And besides,
if anyone should be hitting on her...

00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:46.456
...it's the guy who's single...

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:48.750
...the guy who can do something about it.

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:51.962
Sounds like someone wants to be
Mr. Pizza Delivery Girl.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.214
Well...

00:02:54.382 --> 00:02:56.925
Is that what this is about?
You like Caitlin?

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:03.599
Ha, ha, Ross, we broke up two years
ago. You've been married since then.

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:06.226
I think it's okay
that we see other people.

00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:10.939
- I was watching her at the pizza place.
- Mm-hm.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:15.861
And she was just so sexy and funny
and has the cutest little...

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.030
We don't need her measurements.
Ha, ha.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.450
Pepperoni, pepperoni, pepperoni.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:24.286
I know she's pretty and you love her,
but is she stupid?

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.623
She forgot my vegetarian.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.211
This is perfect. She'll have
to come back here with your pizza.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:35.881
And when she does,
I will turn on the charm "au" Ross.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.093
Oh, I am so glad you don't eat meat.
Ha, ha.

00:03:40.303 --> 00:03:43.805
- See? Vegetarianism benefits everyone.
- Mm.

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.558
Hey, everybody, look who's here!
You remember my grandmother.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.229
- Big night!
- Yeah, it's so cool.

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:52.648
Joey on Law and Order.
You must be very proud.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.525
Chandler, she doesn't understand
a word of English.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:58.195
Ha, ha, I thought you were
Joey's other grandmother.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:02.074
I've done it again.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.119
Nonnie's my biggest fan.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:08.830
She's the only one in the family
who's always believed in me.

00:04:11.876 --> 00:04:13.460
Big star.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.797
My big fat Joey star.

00:04:18.132 --> 00:04:20.342
Yeah. Yeah.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.887
Yeah, I weighed, like,
27 pounds when I was born.

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:27.474
Hey.

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:30.102
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary, 10 months.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.521
- Oh! Mm.
- Mm.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.108
Um, in the shower I was thinking
about our first night in London.

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:38.485
Oh, uh, Joey's grandmother's
right there.

00:04:38.653 --> 00:04:41.196
- The one who speaks English?
- The one who doesn't.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:44.533
That was some hot love you gave me.
Ha-ha-ha.

00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:47.202
- I'll get ready.
- Wear those earrings I got you.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.539
Oh, that's a great idea. I was saving
them for something special.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.291
Mm.

00:04:53.334 --> 00:04:56.586
- You've got to go home.
- But I like it here.

00:04:57.672 --> 00:05:00.841
Go home and get the earrings you borrowed.
He wants me to wear them.

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:04.386
I think they're in my purse.
Go get dressed and I'll look for them.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:05.846
Okay.

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:09.057
Ahem, Rach. Hi.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:10.851
I need those earrings you borrowed.

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.604
Oh. Um...

00:05:14.772 --> 00:05:15.814
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:18.066
- Yeah, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:29.077
Wow, Pheebs, you speak Italian?

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:30.412
I guess so.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.960
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Wait, where's the other one?

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:40.172
Oh, what, you want both of them? Ha, ha.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.050
Rachel Karen Green,
where's the other earring?

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.261
Okay, okay. Look, just don't freak out,
but I kind of lost it.

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:49.973
Oh, I know it's in the apartment,
but I definitely lost it.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:53.518
What'll I tell Monica?
She wants to wear them tonight.

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:57.147
- Tell her to wear her own earrings.
- These are her earrings.

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:59.483
No. No.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.570
You lent me Monica's earrings?
I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.324
- Why not?
- Because I lose her stuff!

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:15.248
He, uh, left a little after 2.

00:06:15.416 --> 00:06:19.127
You see that blind guy right there?
I'm gonna bash his head in later.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:25.342
Oh, uh, my big scene's coming up.
Uh, the big scene coming up.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:29.012
If you said, "Big lima bean bubbling up,"
would she know the difference?

00:06:32.183 --> 00:06:33.517
Rach, what are you doing?

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:37.020
Oh, I just can't watch. It's too scary.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.731
- Huh.
- It's a diaper commercial.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:43.735
Oh, yeah, well, you know me.
Babies, responsibilities...

00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:50.826
- Pizza delivery.
- I'll get it! I will get that!

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:54.746
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:58.250
- One vegetarian pizza. It's 12.50.
- Ah.

00:06:59.043 --> 00:07:02.295
Uh, by the way, if it makes
you feel any better, uh...

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.756
...I happen to like 8-year-old boys.

00:07:09.053 --> 00:07:10.095
What?

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:13.473
Oh, I mean... No, no, no. The, uh...

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:14.975
Your hair. Before. Your hair.

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:18.562
You said you thought your hair
looked like an 8-year-old boy's...

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:21.606
...and I'm just saying I like it.

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:23.358
The hair.

00:07:24.402 --> 00:07:27.028
Oh. Thanks.

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.118
You understand, I don't actually
like 8-year-old boys.

00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:37.330
All I'm looking for is the money.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.208
Here you go.
Now, stop bringing us pizzas, you.

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.794
- I'm gonna try. Ha, ha.
- Okay.

00:07:45.506 --> 00:07:46.590
You're welcome.

00:07:46.757 --> 00:07:49.092
You couldn't let me have her,
could you?

00:07:49.552 --> 00:07:51.386
- What?
- This is a girl I really like...

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:55.474
...and you had to swoop in there!
- What's going on?

00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:58.477
Chandler was flirting
with the hot delivery girl.

00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:01.563
Thank you for that.

00:08:03.691 --> 00:08:04.941
I was not flirting.

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:07.027
It's okay. I don't care. Ha, ha. It's fine.

00:08:07.236 --> 00:08:09.321
- Really?
- Really?

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:11.615
It's no big deal. I do it all the time.

00:08:14.619 --> 00:08:17.996
So, uh... Ahem.
You flirt with guys all the time?

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:22.792
Sure. It doesn't mean anything. Just like
I know it doesn't mean anything with you.

00:08:23.002 --> 00:08:25.420
But there's a big difference.
You're a lot hotter.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.005
True story.

00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:30.008
Ha, ha. This actually bothers you?

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:32.761
Yes, and I think
it'd bother a lot of people.

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:37.057
When you were going out with Ross, did it
bother you when he flirted with other women?

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:41.478
Uh, no. No, it bothered me when
he slept with other women.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.067
And thank you for that.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:50.111
But I never had anything to worry about.

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:52.531
Ross was never very good
at the flirting thing.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.408
What...? What...? Ha, ha.

00:08:55.576 --> 00:08:58.620
What are you talking about?
It worked with you.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:08:59.871
Oh. No, you're right.

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:04.709
We met, you flirted and then,
bam, nine years later, you had me.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.337
All right. All right.

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:10.465
You know what I'm gonna do?
I am gonna order another pizza.

00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.759
And when Caitlin gets here...

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:15.845
...I will show you how well I flirt.

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:18.181
- I will get her phone number.
- Oh, well...

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:20.850
And not the one on the menu.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.314
- I found it.
- Oh, thank God! Where was it?

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:27.524
On your dresser.

00:09:27.692 --> 00:09:31.069
- Okay, that is the one we already have.
- Oh.

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:33.738
Okay, here's my big scene.
My big scene's here.

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:37.450
- What do you bet nobody heard anything?
- No bet.

00:09:38.619 --> 00:09:39.828
Anybody home?

00:09:40.037 --> 00:09:42.247
- Oh, my God.
- What?

00:09:42.415 --> 00:09:46.751
Okay, everybody just keep smiling. It'll kill
my grandmother if she finds out. Ha, ha.

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:50.171
- Oh, what is it?
- Uh, they cut me out of the show.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:52.173
What?

00:09:52.341 --> 00:09:54.801
- Are you sure?
- Maybe your scene's coming up.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:58.263
Not likely. Because you see
that body bag right there?

00:09:58.431 --> 00:09:59.764
- Yeah.
- I'm in it.

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:07.355
This is terrible. What'll you do?

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:10.859
I don't know. But this little old lady
lives for my career.

00:10:11.027 --> 00:10:13.903
When they dumped me off
Days of Our Lives, she almost died.

00:10:14.572 --> 00:10:15.614
That's not good.

00:10:15.823 --> 00:10:19.075
You're not smiling. Not that face!
Smile, everybody smile! Ha, ha.

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:23.288
Why don't you just tell her what happened?
It's not your fault.

00:10:23.497 --> 00:10:27.167
If we keep talking this way,
aren't we gonna freak her out soon?

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:32.672
Oh, uh, soon. I'm gonna be on soon.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.549
There I am!

00:10:35.718 --> 00:10:36.760
No.

00:10:36.927 --> 00:10:38.803
Sam Waterston!

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:41.139
Oh, no, no. That's me. That's me!

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:43.516
No. Sam Waterston.

00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:46.561
Crime Misdemeanor, Capricorn One.

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:49.898
She doesn't know "hello,"
but she knows Capricorn One.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.067
- Phoebe.
- Hmm?

00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:54.736
I need those earrings.
We're leaving when the show's over.

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.031
But I already gave them back to you.

00:11:00.117 --> 00:11:01.201
No, you didn't.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:04.954
All right, I already didn't gave them
back to you. That's what I said.

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:08.124
Ahem. Where's that other earring?

00:11:08.292 --> 00:11:11.127
It's not here, Pheebs. It's not here. Oh!

00:11:11.295 --> 00:11:12.671
I went to Chandler's last night.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.340
Make sure you check
Chandler's jewelry box.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:19.636
Wait a minute, Chandler has a jewelry box?

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:23.348
Okay, we have 10 minutes.
Do you want me to get into that now?

00:11:28.312 --> 00:11:30.063
Hey, Pheebs.

00:11:30.231 --> 00:11:31.856
How's that, uh...

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:35.318
...vegetarian pizza
working out for you, huh?

00:11:37.154 --> 00:11:39.906
You and those, uh, vegetables
have a real, uh...

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.409
...thing going on, huh?

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:46.996
Why are you being weird?

00:11:47.998 --> 00:11:49.916
Do you like it?

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:53.920
No. That would be,
"Why are you being cute?"

00:11:55.256 --> 00:11:57.298
Okay. I'm working on my flirting.

00:11:57.508 --> 00:11:59.759
Oh! I did not get that.

00:12:01.929 --> 00:12:04.180
So, uh, Monica, do you like
Law and Order?

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.640
- Yeah, it's good.
- Oh.

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:08.810
I found out all this stuff about you.
You like Law and Order...

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:11.396
...and you've flirted with every guy
in the tri-state area.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:13.440
Shh. Shh.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.735
Okay, let me get this straight.

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:19.821
It's okay for you to flirt, but not for me?

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.823
Oh, I'm so glad we cleared that up.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:26.411
Look, I'm sorry, but some things
are different for men and women.

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.413
Go on, teach me about men and women.

00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:31.583
Okay. I've already taught you
so much already, but whatever.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.545
When you flirt with a guy,
you think, "No big deal."

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:39.382
But the guy thinks, "Finally!
Somebody who wants to sleep with me."

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:41.593
- No way!
- It's true.

00:12:42.261 --> 00:12:44.763
- Well, that's pathetic.
- Again, true.

00:12:45.806 --> 00:12:48.933
- This goes for all guys?
- All guys that are awake.

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:50.769
Then we go to sleep.

00:12:50.936 --> 00:12:54.981
All guys from the other end of the world
wake up and behave the exact same way.

00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:59.194
All right. It's another commercial
and I still haven't told her.

00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:02.238
Joey, this is the last commercial.

00:13:02.406 --> 00:13:04.407
- You got, like, 10 minutes left.
- I know!

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:06.534
What am I gonna do? Oh!

00:13:06.744 --> 00:13:09.037
You are not gonna run out
and leave her here.

00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:14.083
Yeah, all right. Oh!

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:18.838
Joey?

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:23.218
Uh, Joey's gonna be right back.
Right back?

00:13:24.804 --> 00:13:27.013
Meanwhile, let's talk about you.

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:31.601
So, you're old and small.

00:13:37.441 --> 00:13:39.818
- Hey.
- Did you find it?

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:42.237
The earring, no.
But I found my sunglasses.

00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:45.198
I've been looking for these
since last summer.

00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:48.368
Those are my sunglasses.
You borrowed them from me.

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:52.330
Okay. Calm down. Here they are.

00:13:53.207 --> 00:13:54.457
Phoebe.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:58.837
- What do we do?
- I don't know. I don't know!

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:02.841
We'll just have to tell Monica, that's all.

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:06.052
Oh, God! She's gonna kill me.

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:08.972
- Oh.
- I could tell her it was all my fault.

00:14:09.181 --> 00:14:10.765
Oh, that'd be great.

00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:15.270
Mon, could I talk to you?

00:14:15.437 --> 00:14:18.273
- Yeah. What is it?
- Um...

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.483
I lost one of your earrings.

00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:23.528
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:25.530
Wow.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:30.660
All right, well, I mean, what can you do?
If you lost it, you lost it.

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:33.204
I'll replace it, I promise. I feel so terrible.

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:35.498
That's fine. You didn't do it on purpose.

00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:36.875
- No.
- Oh.

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:39.002
Look at you. Come here.

00:14:39.169 --> 00:14:40.712
Aw.

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.966
- You feel better? Ha, ha.
- Yeah. You're the best.

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:47.385
Okay, wait a minute.

00:14:48.345 --> 00:14:50.221
Wait a minute, I can't do this.

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:52.724
Listen, honey, it's not Phoebe's fault.

00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:54.684
She lent me the earrings.

00:14:54.894 --> 00:14:58.438
I lost it. I'm so sorry, honey.
I feel terrible too.

00:14:59.982 --> 00:15:02.400
That is exactly why
I do not lend you stuff!

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:07.655
First it's my jewelry.
If it's not that, it's my sweater.

00:15:07.865 --> 00:15:10.199
And if it's not my sweater,
it's my sunglasses.

00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:12.368
- Your sunglasses?
- Yes.

00:15:12.536 --> 00:15:13.995
Oh, right.

00:15:15.372 --> 00:15:18.124
- Pizza.
- Mine, mine, mine!

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.752
Okay, here goes.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.172
Prepare yourselves
for some class-A flirting.

00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:26.090
Okay, hold on.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:27.634
Okay.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:33.473
If you really like this girl,
I don't think flirting is the right way...

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:35.266
Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:37.226
You'll see.

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:38.770
Okay.

00:15:40.814 --> 00:15:42.607
Oh, what's her name?

00:15:42.816 --> 00:15:43.942
Caitlin!

00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:46.110
Caitlin.

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:53.493
Hey.

00:15:53.661 --> 00:15:56.204
Oh, we can't keep eating like this.
Ha, ha.

00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:00.833
Heh. It's, uh, $12.50.

00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:02.627
Okay, um...

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:04.754
So...

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.552
Do you make the pizzas in one
of those, uh, wood-burning ovens?

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:16.015
No, actually, I think they're gas.

00:16:16.225 --> 00:16:18.601
Gas? Wow, ha, ha.

00:16:20.604 --> 00:16:21.646
Intense.

00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:26.818
If this is the way all the Gellers flirt,
we don't have a problem.

00:16:28.195 --> 00:16:29.654
Hey, uh...

00:16:29.822 --> 00:16:32.407
You know that smell gas has?

00:16:37.246 --> 00:16:38.287
Yeah.

00:16:38.455 --> 00:16:40.331
They put that in.

00:16:41.041 --> 00:16:42.125
What?

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.377
The gas is odorless.

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:49.465
But they add the smell
so you know when there's a leak.

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:52.385
Well, okay.

00:16:54.638 --> 00:16:57.432
A lot of other gas smells.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.397
Oh, the humanity.

00:17:07.735 --> 00:17:10.903
Methane smells...

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:15.158
You know what?
Um, actually, I really should go.

00:17:15.367 --> 00:17:18.327
- Oh, but I haven't paid you yet.
- That's okay.

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:21.581
You guys have ordered so many
that this one's on me.

00:17:22.791 --> 00:17:23.958
Last I heard...

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:27.837
...the cops had over 600
reported missing women still.

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:29.047
Six hundred.

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:33.301
Was I talking to her about gas?

00:17:34.595 --> 00:17:36.929
More so than anything else.

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:41.350
I found it interesting.

00:17:43.771 --> 00:17:44.812
I'm sorry.

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:47.148
Hey, hey. Don't worry about it.

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:51.819
In nine years, she and I
will be right there! Ha, ha.

00:17:57.201 --> 00:18:00.745
Okay. Well, I'm gonna clear out
some of these boxes.

00:18:07.252 --> 00:18:08.461
- Ross?
- Yeah?

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:11.214
What else do they add smell to?

00:18:15.636 --> 00:18:17.887
Caitlin! Caitlin! Hi.

00:18:18.055 --> 00:18:20.348
Hi, I'm Rachel. Oh.

00:18:20.557 --> 00:18:22.475
From upstairs, people with all the pizza.

00:18:22.643 --> 00:18:24.143
Oh, was there a problem?

00:18:24.353 --> 00:18:26.354
No, they're fine. Great pizza.

00:18:26.522 --> 00:18:29.524
But, actually, um, my friend Ross...

00:18:29.691 --> 00:18:33.569
...he just gets really nervous
when he's flirting.

00:18:33.987 --> 00:18:36.614
Oh, my God! That was flirting?

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:38.241
- Yeah.
- Wow.

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:40.284
I know, I know.

00:18:40.452 --> 00:18:43.704
I'm telling you,
once you get past that part...

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:46.332
...where it just feels like you wanna die...

00:18:46.583 --> 00:18:48.501
...he's a really good person.

00:18:48.669 --> 00:18:51.295
- The guy with the gas?
- Yeah.

00:18:51.505 --> 00:18:54.590
I'm telling you, he's really
sweet and really funny...

00:18:54.758 --> 00:18:57.051
...and he's just, oh, got a good heart.

00:18:57.261 --> 00:19:01.347
- And besides, I think he really likes you.
- Really?

00:19:01.557 --> 00:19:05.518
Well, we have seven people
and 10 pizzas. What do you think?

00:19:05.727 --> 00:19:08.521
I thought Joey was there.

00:19:11.024 --> 00:19:13.442
You've got till Monday.
Then I move to dismiss.

00:19:16.363 --> 00:19:17.405
Hey, Ross?

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:20.992
Um, I just ran into Caitlin
in the hallway.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.996
Uh, you must be getting better at
this flirting stuff than I thought. Ha, ha.

00:19:25.205 --> 00:19:26.581
- What?
- I don't get it...

00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:29.542
...but she wanted me
to give you her phone number.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.169
Oh.

00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:36.465
And she just gave you this?

00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:38.009
Yeah.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:43.431
Rach, thanks. But I don't need
you doing me any favors.

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:46.100
I didn't. I didn't. She thought you were cute.

00:19:47.477 --> 00:19:48.686
Well, that I can believe.

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.730
Yeah.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.983
Hey, is the show still on?

00:19:54.193 --> 00:19:55.526
Almost over, man.

00:19:55.694 --> 00:19:57.069
Hey, Nonnie.

00:19:57.237 --> 00:19:58.529
Oh! Is that the Pope?

00:19:58.697 --> 00:19:59.822
Hey.

00:20:02.117 --> 00:20:03.951
Why am I looking?

00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:06.621
Oh, Nonnie, here I am!
This is my big scene.

00:20:07.247 --> 00:20:09.165
All right, back off!

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:12.919
I got a gun!

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:14.837
I'm not afraid to use it.

00:20:15.047 --> 00:20:16.088
Oh, Joey.

00:20:16.256 --> 00:20:17.715
That's right, Nonnie.

00:20:17.883 --> 00:20:20.468
You couldn't have at least
changed your shirt?

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.722
Now, I want a suitcase
filled with $100,000...

00:20:26.099 --> 00:20:27.767
Shh! Shoo, shoo!

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:31.187
Filled with $100,000 in small bills.

00:20:31.355 --> 00:20:33.773
And if I don't get... Shoo!

00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:36.234
And if I don't get it...

00:20:37.694 --> 00:20:39.278
...I'm gonna shoot this duck!

00:20:39.696 --> 00:20:41.697
Oh, no!

00:20:42.574 --> 00:20:44.700

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.168
And she's supposed to buy this?

00:20:58.382 --> 00:21:01.509
Ground control to Major Tom

00:21:03.637 --> 00:21:05.638
Commencing countdown

00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:07.723
Engines

00:21:08.183 --> 00:21:09.850
On

00:21:16.024 --> 00:21:18.859
That's, uh, scenes
from next week's show. Next week.

00:21:20.612 --> 00:21:22.947
I am definitely gonna watch that.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.454
What about these?
Do these look the same?

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:32.707
- Definitely.
- Not as each other.

00:21:32.874 --> 00:21:34.667
Oh, then, no.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.255
- Hey, you ready?
- Hi. Yeah.

00:21:39.506 --> 00:21:40.798
- You look amazing.
- Aw.

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.758
I'm the luckiest man in the world.

00:21:42.926 --> 00:21:45.594
- Oh, you're about to get a little luckier.
- Mm-hm.

00:21:45.762 --> 00:21:48.472
- Let me see the earrings.
- Oh, right, the earrings.

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:50.224
They look great.

00:21:50.392 --> 00:21:52.893
Does your boyfriend have
the best taste or what?

00:21:54.479 --> 00:21:56.147
My boyfriend really does
have great taste.

00:22:01.945 --> 00:22:03.988
- Thanks for picking out the earrings.
- Mm-hm.
