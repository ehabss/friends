WEBVTT

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:06.213
Hello?

00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.382
- Hey, Joey!
- Hey, Pheebs.

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:09.842
Can you do me a favor?

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.429
I forgot the PIN to my ATM card.
Can you get it for me?

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:14.680
Sure. Where is it?

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.933
Uh, I scratched it on the ATM machine
on the corner.

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.894
Oh, so you're 5-6-3-9?

00:00:21.104 --> 00:00:22.771
That's it! Thanks.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.817
- Wanna talk to Chandler?
- Let me talk to him.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:28.819
He didn't believe in my movie...

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.240
...which is a big mistake,
because it is real. Real.

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:35.617
I've tried to apologize.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:39.413
If I can't do it on the phone,
I'll go and do it in person.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.665
I heard that. Uh, can you put him on?

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:42.875
Yeah.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:46.378
- Hey.
- Don't come out here.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:51.925
I support you 100 percent
and I wanna prove that to you in person.

00:00:52.135 --> 00:00:55.387
I got that. I forgive you.
Don't come out here.

00:00:55.597 --> 00:00:57.765
You haven't taken
my calls for a week.

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:01.810
I'm totally over it. Friends forever.
Don't come out here.

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.481
Would you mind doing
a picture with us?

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:07.357
Uh, what was that?

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:09.359
Uh, Entertainment Tonight.

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:14.490
Good talking to you
and don't come out here.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:56.031
Monica?

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:58.742
I'm sorry I'm late.

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.205
Monica?

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.332
Phoebe?

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.378
I'm so sorry.
Have you been here long?

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:11.255
That's okay.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:14.049
What the hell took you so long?

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.887
You can't tell Chandler.
I ran into Richard.

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:20.556
- Which Richard?
- The Richard.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:22.933
Richard Simmons? Oh, my God!

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:28.522
No, my ex-boyfriend Richard.
You know, the tall guy, mustache.

00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:32.109
Okay, that actually makes more sense.
How was it?

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:36.113
It was really nice. We talked
and I had lunch with him.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.449
That's weird. I dreamed
you had lunch with Richard.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:41.577
- Really?
- Again, Richard Simmons.

00:02:42.328 --> 00:02:43.370
Go on.

00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:46.081
The strange part was
he was really nice...

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:49.209
...and he looks great,
but I didn't feel anything.

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.253
So why can't we tell Chandler?

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:56.049
It'll freak him out and tomorrow's our
anniversary. I don't wanna spoil it.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.344
I can't believe you guys
have lasted a whole year!

00:02:59.554 --> 00:03:01.847
Wow, I owe Rachel 20 bucks.

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:03.932
What?

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:05.934
On a totally different bet.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:09.313
Hey!

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.940
- It's almost our anniversary!
- I know.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.235
One year ago today, I was just
your annoying friend Chandler.

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:18.906
Aw, now you're just
my annoying friend Chandler.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.575
- Huh.
- I got you a gift.

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:25.579
- It's not till tomorrow.
- I know, but you have to open it today.

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.427
Okay! There you go!

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:43.347
- It's two tickets to Vegas!
- Wow.

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:46.475
Yeah! For this weekend!
It'll be perfect.

00:03:46.684 --> 00:03:50.812
You'll see Joey, plus, we'll start
our celebration on the plane.

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.107
We can call it our "Plane-a-versary."

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:56.235
We have to?

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:01.657
This is great, but Joey didn't want
any of us there.

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:06.578
He doesn't want us to go to any trouble.
He'll be excited when we surprise him.

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.666
Plus, we get to have
our own "Anna-Vegas-ry"!

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.295
"Anna-vada-versary!"

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.757
I think we should see other people.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:20.300
We can go, right?

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:21.802
Great idea.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.303
I'm gonna go too!

00:04:26.474 --> 00:04:28.600
Pheebs, it's kind of
our anniversary.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.561
You won't ditch me
like you did with London.

00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:33.605
Ditch you?
You were pregnant...

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.357
Uh-huh. Great story. I'm going.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.195
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:44.658
Listen, this weekend we're all gonna go
to Las Vegas to surprise Joey!

00:04:46.619 --> 00:04:48.161
Including me!

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.871
Do you wanna go?

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.999
I can take a couple days off work.

00:04:52.208 --> 00:04:56.628
Of course you can take a couple days
off, because this trip includes me!

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:01.717
I've got a presentation tomorrow.
I can't miss that.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:05.971
I've got tickets to the Van Gogh
exhibit. I waited a year for this.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:10.100
- Rach, maybe we can fly out Saturday?
- Sounds great.

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.768
I'll call the airlines.

00:05:12.687 --> 00:05:15.605
That'll be nice to have
the apartment to myself.

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:17.774
To walk around naked.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:23.739
No, so I can be by myself.
Have a little alone time.

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:25.615
Naked alone time.

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:30.078
Just because I'm alone doesn't mean
I wanna walk around naked.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.706
You live alone,
you don't walk around naked.

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:35.834
Uh-huh. Why does it takes me so long
to answer the door?

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:47.137
So far, is this trip to Las Vegas
better or worse than the trip to London?

00:05:47.388 --> 00:05:50.015
So far, it's pretty much
the same, Pheebs.

00:05:50.767 --> 00:05:53.977
What about after I give you
these candies?

00:05:55.313 --> 00:05:57.689
- I guess it's a little better now.
- Ha, ha.

00:05:58.441 --> 00:06:01.902
Las Vegas, 1. London, 0.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:03.570
I'll be back.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:08.950
Happy Plane-a-versary.

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:12.162
Aw. I love you.

00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:15.248
- Can I give you your present now?
- Okay!

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.838
Oh, don't tell me I did this.

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:25.467
I love "I forgot the present" fake-out!

00:06:26.177 --> 00:06:29.888
How about "I did forget the present,
forgive me" not fake-out?

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.891
You can give it to me
when we get back.

00:06:33.142 --> 00:06:35.519
This is the worst thing
that could happen.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:38.647
You decided to tell him
about the Richard thing.

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.194
What "Richard thing"?

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.279
Oh, no.

00:06:48.074 --> 00:06:49.116
What "Richard thing"?

00:06:49.325 --> 00:06:51.118
Simmons. Go with Simmons.

00:06:58.292 --> 00:07:00.252
I ran into Richard yesterday.

00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:04.172
He asked me if I wanted to go
for a bite and I did.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:06.967
I didn't tell you
because you'd get mad...

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:09.678
...and I didn't wanna spoil
our anniversary.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.763
I'm not mad.

00:07:13.766 --> 00:07:14.808
Really?

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:19.271
So you bumped into Richard.
You grabbed a "bite."

00:07:21.858 --> 00:07:23.442
No big deal.

00:07:26.612 --> 00:07:27.946
Great.

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:34.077
Okay, London, 1.

00:07:40.751 --> 00:07:42.252
Ooh.

00:07:54.515 --> 00:07:56.016
Hmm.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.566
Oh, look what happened.

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:08.820
Huh, check me out.

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:11.364
I'm in my kitchen...

00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:13.116
...naked.

00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:16.453
I'm picking up an orange.

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:17.996
I'm naked.

00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:23.335
I'm lighting the candles.

00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:26.338
Naked. And carefully.

00:08:37.308 --> 00:08:40.227
Oh, my God! That's Rachel, naked!

00:08:42.396 --> 00:08:45.023
I can't look at that.
I am looking at this.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:49.194
Okay, vivid colors,
expressive brush strokes.

00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:54.199
Unless she wants me
to be looking at that.

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.618
She knows I'm home.

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:59.746
She knows I can see her.

00:08:59.997 --> 00:09:03.583
What kind of game is she playing?

00:09:03.834 --> 00:09:07.796
I think maybe someone's lonely tonight.

00:09:08.464 --> 00:09:10.257
Oh, Dr. Geller.

00:09:10.508 --> 00:09:15.178
Stop it. You're being silly. Ha, ha.

00:09:15.346 --> 00:09:17.138
Or am I?

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.893
Love to love you baby

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:23.603
Ow

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:27.023
Love to love you baby
Ow

00:09:34.323 --> 00:09:37.117
Love to love you baby
Ow

00:09:38.494 --> 00:09:39.828
Darn it!

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.463
Hey.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.095
May I come in?

00:09:58.139 --> 00:09:59.806
Uh, yeah, if you want to.

00:10:00.808 --> 00:10:02.726
Do you want me to?

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.645
Yeah, sure?

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:07.689
So do I.

00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:15.822
Okay, Rach, before anything happens...

00:10:16.073 --> 00:10:18.783
...I wanna lay down a couple
of ground rules.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.661
This is just about tonight.

00:10:21.954 --> 00:10:26.082
I won't go through with this
if it'll raise the question of "us."

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.628
I just want this to be...

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.758
...about what it is.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:40.138
And, um...

00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:42.182
...what is that, Ross?

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:45.018
The physical act of love.

00:10:46.562 --> 00:10:47.979
What, are you crazy?

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:53.109
So you weren't trying to entice me
just now with your nakedness?

00:10:55.946 --> 00:10:58.406
Oh, God. You saw me?

00:11:02.119 --> 00:11:06.289
You weren't trying to entice me
with your nakedness?

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.540
No!

00:11:07.792 --> 00:11:11.920
You actually thought
I wanted to have sex with you?

00:11:15.758 --> 00:11:17.050
No!

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:21.805
No.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.184
No, no, no, no.

00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:51.710
Hey, you guys, wait! You guys.

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.212
This place is much better than London.

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:57.090
A lady dressed like Cleopatra
gave me this.

00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.926
Ninety-nine cent
steak and lobster dinner. Huh.

00:12:00.094 --> 00:12:01.469
You don't eat animals.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.972
For ninety-nine cents I'd eat you.

00:12:05.433 --> 00:12:07.600
I can totally settle down here.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.980
It's got everything I could ever want.
Including Joey! Look!

00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:14.232
Look! Hey!

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:15.775
Oh, my God.

00:12:16.193 --> 00:12:17.819
Hey, Joey!

00:12:21.365 --> 00:12:22.615
- Wow!
- Hi.

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:24.367
Love your condoms, my man.

00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:28.163
Why are you here?
I told you not to come.

00:12:28.372 --> 00:12:30.373
Why are you dressed as a gladiator?

00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:35.211
Uh, because I'm shooting a scene right now.
I play a gladiator.

00:12:36.922 --> 00:12:39.340
Hold on a second. Can we cut?

00:12:39.592 --> 00:12:42.093
My friends are here.
I'm gonna take a break.

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:44.220
Who are you talking to?

00:12:45.514 --> 00:12:46.598
The director.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:48.475
Uh, her.

00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:54.731
All right, it's not a gladiator movie.
I work here.

00:12:54.982 --> 00:12:56.399
Why? What happened?

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.735
The movie shut down.
Ran out of money.

00:12:58.944 --> 00:13:02.238
I'm working here till it starts up,
if it ever does.

00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:04.157
- I'm so sorry.
- Such a drag.

00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:06.618
Sorry I didn't tell you. I'm sorry.

00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:09.996
Apparently there's
a new policy of not sharing.

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:13.708
- I knew you weren't okay with that.
- So you're a gladiator!

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.085
What's going on?

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:19.172
- Monica had lunch with Richard.
- Dawson?

00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:21.591
No...

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.260
But that would've been so cool!

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:26.095
Her boyfriend Richard.

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:30.600
It meant nothing. After all this time,
how can you not trust me?

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:34.270
When you go lunching with hunky men
and don't tell me!

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.275
You're right. I'm sorry.
I should've told you.

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:40.902
Thanks.

00:13:41.821 --> 00:13:44.614
- Aw, there we go.
- Now I love Vegas.

00:13:45.699 --> 00:13:48.785
I promise you next time
I absolutely will tell you.

00:13:52.206 --> 00:13:53.248
"Next time"?

00:13:53.707 --> 00:13:55.208
Ooh, so close.

00:13:56.126 --> 00:13:59.254
There won't be a next time.
You cannot see him again.

00:13:59.463 --> 00:14:03.091
I cannot see him?
You can't tell me what to do.

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.301
That's funny, I think I just did.

00:14:06.345 --> 00:14:09.055
If you act like this,
I won't be around you.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.932
- Fine.
- Happy anniversary!

00:14:11.141 --> 00:14:13.560
Guys, please! Come on, come on.

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:15.895
This is obviously
a misunderstanding.

00:14:16.146 --> 00:14:18.106
- No, it's not.
- What're you talking about?

00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:20.108
Don't look at me. I just work here.

00:14:24.321 --> 00:14:28.992
Okay, um, Ross? I'm a little warm,
so I'm gonna be taking off my sweater.

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:31.786
Now, I'm just letting you know...

00:14:32.037 --> 00:14:36.124
...this is not an invitation
to the physical act of love.

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:40.086
Yep, that's hilarious.

00:14:40.921 --> 00:14:42.922
I'm sorry. I'm done. I'm done.

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:46.259
You know, last night was
embarrassing for you too.

00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:48.386
No, not really.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:51.389
But you know,
I just don't embarrass that easily.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:53.725
What? You totally get embarrassed.

00:14:53.934 --> 00:14:58.521
No, I don't. Ross, I think I'm just
a more secure person than you are.

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.398
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:03.443
Hey, lady!

00:15:03.652 --> 00:15:06.029
I don't care how much
you want it, okay?

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.240
I am not gonna have sex
with you in the bathroom!

00:15:14.538 --> 00:15:17.832
You know, in Roman times,
this was more than just a hat.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:19.667
Really?

00:15:19.877 --> 00:15:21.169
Yeah, sure, sure.

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.421
They would scrub the floors.

00:15:23.672 --> 00:15:26.215
They'd use it to get the mud
off their shoe.

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:29.260
Sometimes underneath
the horse would get dirty.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.262
So they would stick it right...

00:15:32.139 --> 00:15:35.183
I can't believe this is how
I'm spending my anniversary.

00:15:35.392 --> 00:15:38.770
I'll take you someplace nice.
A guy tipped me $100.

00:15:38.979 --> 00:15:40.021
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:43.483
He was playing blackjack
for an hour and he won $5000.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:45.401
Can you believe that?

00:15:45.611 --> 00:15:47.820
If I won $5000, I'd join a gym.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.489
Build up my upper body...

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:52.200
...and hit Richard from behind
with a stick.

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:56.287
Wait! Why don't I just
do what that guy did?

00:15:56.538 --> 00:15:58.706
I'll take this $100,
turn it into $5000...

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.210
...and I'll turn that into enough
to get my movie going!

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:04.504
Good luck.

00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:08.216
- I don't need luck. I've thought this through.
- I see.

00:16:13.347 --> 00:16:15.098
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:19.102
I can't believe this.
This is like the worst night ever.

00:16:19.311 --> 00:16:22.730
You had a minor setback
in your relationship.

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.649
Big deal. It's only Chandler.

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:29.195
I am so sorry.

00:16:31.073 --> 00:16:34.200
This is crazy having
such a stupid argument.

00:16:34.451 --> 00:16:36.160
I don't wanna see Richard.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.329
So go fix it.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.249
Find Chandler.
He's probably in your room.

00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.376
Tell him sorry and you love him.

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:45.670
You're right, Phoebe.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:47.338
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:51.884
Yeah! Las Vegas! Number one!

00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:04.063
- Anybody lose this?
- Coming out.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:05.523
Place your bet.

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:08.067
Dice her out.

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.405
Yellow 11. Pay the front line!

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:18.369
Hmm.

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:24.667
So, uh, I'm on my way
back to the bathroom.

00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:30.923
All right, all right.
Just keep walking, all right?

00:17:40.642 --> 00:17:42.477
What are you... I am sorry, sir.

00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:45.688
I think he just really likes you.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:51.194
Hey...

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:55.073
You know that teacher who had a baby
with her student?

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.086
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:13.132
Do you have any extra pants? Uh, my friend
seems to have had a little accident.

00:18:18.806 --> 00:18:21.474
- Can I change 100?
- Changing 100.

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:24.811
- Good luck, sir.
- Thanks.

00:18:26.688 --> 00:18:28.022
That's right.

00:18:32.986 --> 00:18:35.071
- Thirteen.
- Hit me!

00:18:36.532 --> 00:18:38.533
Oh, man!

00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:42.495
Wait!

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:46.791
You are not gonna believe this!

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.752
I have found my identical hand twin.

00:18:53.799 --> 00:18:55.049
What?

00:18:55.926 --> 00:18:57.760
My identical hand twin!

00:18:59.638 --> 00:19:01.305
What's an identical hand twin?

00:19:01.515 --> 00:19:05.184
It was incredible. The dealer's hands
were exactly like mine.

00:19:05.435 --> 00:19:07.854
It was like looking
at my hands in a mirror!

00:19:09.439 --> 00:19:12.400
You sure you weren't
looking at your hands in a mirror?

00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:17.280
Don't you see what this means?
I can forget about that stupid movie.

00:19:17.489 --> 00:19:19.073
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:22.368
How?

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:24.912
I don't have it all worked out yet.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:28.791
But it's gotta mean big money.
Come on, identical hands!

00:19:30.419 --> 00:19:32.420
Again, I must go back to...

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:34.088
...how?

00:19:35.424 --> 00:19:39.177
This is Vegas, man.
People will pay to see freaky stuff!

00:19:41.096 --> 00:19:43.681
How much would you pay
to see this hand...

00:19:43.932 --> 00:19:46.184
...twice? Huh?

00:19:49.396 --> 00:19:51.981
I can't really put a price on that.

00:19:52.816 --> 00:19:54.859
Are you un-supporting me again?

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.402
No. No.

00:19:56.653 --> 00:20:00.281
I support you 100 percent.
I just didn't get it right away.

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:01.949
Now I'm caught up.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.035
Identical hand twins.

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.703
It's a million-dollar idea!

00:20:11.418 --> 00:20:12.501
- Hey!
- Pheebs!

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:14.587
I found my identical hand twin!

00:20:14.796 --> 00:20:17.006
Oh, you're so lucky!

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:24.472
So where's Monica?
Did you guys make up?

00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:27.600
- No.
- But she just came up here.

00:20:27.935 --> 00:20:29.518
That was Joey.

00:20:30.145 --> 00:20:32.271
I wonder where she is? It's so weird.

00:20:32.481 --> 00:20:34.357
She's probably talking to Richard.

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:36.234
Would you stop that?

00:20:36.902 --> 00:20:40.154
You know what she said
after her lunch with Richard?

00:20:40.405 --> 00:20:43.241
She didn't feel anything for him.
She loves you.

00:20:44.618 --> 00:20:46.285
- Really?
- Yes.

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:50.873
She feels terrible. She really wants
to make up. You've gotta find her.

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:53.834
Okay.

00:20:54.378 --> 00:20:55.586
Good.

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.971
I should really start wearing hats.

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:52.476
Welcome to Las Vegas.

00:21:53.603 --> 00:21:55.771
- Did you enjoy your flight?
- I did.

00:21:55.981 --> 00:21:58.524
Thank you very much.
It was excellent.

00:21:59.735 --> 00:22:03.738
- I hope you had a nice flight.
- Oh, it was the best.
