WEBVTT

00:00:02.002 --> 00:00:03.877
Previously on Friends:

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:06.296
Don't come out here.

00:00:06.506 --> 00:00:09.717
- I ran into Richard.
- Which Richard?

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:11.176
My ex-boyfriend.

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.721
This is the worst thing
that could happen.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.017
You decided to tell him
about the Richard thing.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.311
Oh, no.

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:24.440
- You can't see him.
- You can't tell me what to do.

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:27.484
That's funny, I think I just did.

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:31.739
- I have found my identical hand twin.
- What's that?

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:36.744
A guy with my identical hands.
I'm gonna be a millionaire!

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.670
You thought
I wanted to have sex with you?

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:48.255
No.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.717
Last night was embarrassing
for you too.

00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:54.636
I just don't embarrass that easily.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.606
- I think the check-in is that way.
- Ah.

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:09.943
Hello.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.282
Ah, kids love me.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:18.577
Hey! Hi. You guys are here!

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:22.206
Yay! What'd you do?
Did you go to a costume party?

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.501
Let me guess. Um, Pancho Villa.

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.463
And you're Bob Saget.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.883
Pancho Villa?

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.845
What are you talking about, Pheebs?
I don't...

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:43.644
Oh, my God! You drew on me?

00:01:43.853 --> 00:01:45.938
Hey, you wet my pants!

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.607
Whoa, what kind of party was this?

00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:53.320
I've been walking around like this?
You have so crossed a line.

00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:56.824
Rach, wait.
The men's room is that way.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.205
- Oh!
- What?

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:06.875
It's the third time she's won
on a machine I was playing.

00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:09.628
Oh. I bet she's one of those people.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.548
Mole people?

00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:14.800
What? No, a lurker.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:16.677
Oh. What's that?

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:19.555
When you're playing a machine
and it hasn't paid out...

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.224
...a lurker waits for you
to give up and then...

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:23.433
Kills you?

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.230
No, they swoop in and steal your jackpot.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:30.149
- Oh.
- Mm-hm.

00:02:30.358 --> 00:02:33.485
- How do you know about this?
- My nana used to do it.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.780
That's how she paid for my dance...
Karate lessons.

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.074
Dance karate?

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.827
Yes, it's a deadly...

00:02:42.036 --> 00:02:43.912
...but beautiful sport.

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.960
- It won't come off.
- What?

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.336
It won't come off.

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.755
Oh, my God. Rach, are you sure?

00:02:53.965 --> 00:02:56.383
I took it off,
and then I drew it back on.

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.636
Hey! You made it!

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:04.099
Who's your friend? He's hot.

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:06.935
Thanks, man.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:11.148
Listen, I talked to Chandler,
and I'm sorry about the movie.

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:12.399
Don't be sorry.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.986
I don't need it anymore.
I found my identical hand twin.

00:03:16.654 --> 00:03:17.696
Your what?

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:21.408
My identical hand twin.
The person whose hands are like mine.

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:22.951
This is a gold mine.

00:03:23.161 --> 00:03:24.411
What?

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.081
That won't make you any money.

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:29.625
Well, fine.

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:33.253
None of you will live with me
in my hand-shaped mansion.

00:03:35.173 --> 00:03:37.549
Except, uh, you.
You can live in the thumb.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.550
All right, baby, come on!

00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:21.927
Yes! Yes!

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:24.513
- I am on fire!
- See you later.

00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.682
What are you doing?

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:28.558
What's it look like? Going home.

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:30.269
Why?

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:32.271
Chandler.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.730
Chandler, wait.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.817
Sorry, I was just playing
for one second.

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:40.362
If you don't want me to see
Richard again, I won't.

00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:42.239
He means nothing to me.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.741
Oh, come on. I was there.

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.288
I know he's the love of your life.

00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:51.873
Not anymore.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.209
Really?

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.837
Really.

00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.425
All right?

00:05:01.634 --> 00:05:05.429
Let's forget about going home
and celebrate our anniversary.

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:08.682
Okay, this is empty.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.853
I wanted to make a dramatic scene,
but I hate packing.

00:05:17.358 --> 00:05:18.608
Where's the other guy?

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:20.319
Which guy?

00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:23.196
Tall, dark hair, hand looks
exactly like this?

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.492
I don't know about the hands,
but he went to the restroom.

00:05:27.702 --> 00:05:29.161
Okay.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.836
- How you doing?
- Very busy.

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.588
Right. Okay.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.178
Yes, hello. I have a question.

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:51.558
Um, I used your pen to draw
on my friend's face.

00:05:52.393 --> 00:05:54.478
A beard and a mustache.

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.358
Thank you.

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:02.694
No, she didn't think so.

00:06:02.904 --> 00:06:04.905
I know. It's like... Anyway...

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:10.702
Makeup didn't cover it. We've tried
everything, and nothing's worked.

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:12.788
What do we do?

00:06:13.623 --> 00:06:15.624
Yeah. Uh-huh.

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:19.252
Yeah. Oh, okay.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.296
Okay, thank you.

00:06:21.506 --> 00:06:23.382
Yeah, it's not coming off.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.134
What? What else did he say?

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.596
Um, he said he thought I was funny.

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:34.643
Okay, look. Let's just go downstairs...

00:06:34.852 --> 00:06:38.230
...we'll have some fun,
and you will forget all about it.

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:41.525
There's no way I am leaving
looking like this!

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:43.819
Come on, Rach. It's not that bad.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.071
Ross, I am a human doodle!

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:51.785
Just because some idiot drew on your
face doesn't mean you can't have fun.

00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:54.246
Besides, no one will even look at you.

00:06:54.455 --> 00:06:58.291
This is Vegas. Hello?
There are tons of other freaks here.

00:06:59.794 --> 00:07:04.881
There are tons of freaks here.
No other. No.

00:07:05.133 --> 00:07:07.843
Come on. No one will notice. I swear.

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:17.727
There was some staring and pointing.

00:07:19.689 --> 00:07:20.939
I need a drink.

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.317
They really overcharge you
for that stuff.

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:29.114
But who cares,
because it's all on me.

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:36.288
That is one big drink.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:38.498
Macadamia nut?

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:42.169
Um, wow! That's some pricey nut.

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:46.798
Really like those macadamia nuts, huh?

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.009
Nope.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:02.522
Get out of here, you lurker!

00:08:02.773 --> 00:08:04.065
Go on, get!

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.945
- Hey, Pheebs.
- You made up.

00:08:09.614 --> 00:08:11.698
I couldn't be mad at him for too long.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:13.909
She couldn't live
without the "Chand love."

00:08:16.537 --> 00:08:17.954
Aw.

00:08:18.122 --> 00:08:20.290
Get a room.

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.459
- We have one.
- I know. Use it.

00:08:26.297 --> 00:08:27.672
Oh, yeah.

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:31.968
That's right.
Take good care of those babies.

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:34.804
- Excuse me?
- It's me. Joey.

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.307
Do I know you?

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.892
Joey?

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.229
Oh, yeah.

00:08:42.438 --> 00:08:44.731
Yeah, the hand guy.

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:48.276
So, what are we gonna do
about this hand twin thing?

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:50.737
Nothing.

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:54.783
Look, you and I have been given a gift.

00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:58.912
We have to do something with it.
Like hand modeling. Or magic.

00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:01.873
And you know NASA's
gonna want to talk to us.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:05.377
- I have to get back to work.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.462
We can have our own show.

00:09:07.672 --> 00:09:10.882
We can clap our hands together.
People will love it!

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:12.801
Huh?

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:14.886
And I wrote a song for us.

00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:17.681
This hand is your hand

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:21.226
This hand is my hand

00:09:21.727 --> 00:09:24.020
Oh, wait, that's your hand

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:28.400
No, wait, it's my hand

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:34.573
- That's okay.
- But you haven't even heard the chorus!

00:09:37.034 --> 00:09:38.285
Oh, my God.

00:09:38.703 --> 00:09:41.162
I look like my great-aunt, Muriel.

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.415
All right, you know what?

00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:45.750
We don't have to go downstairs.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.587
We can bring Vegas up to us.

00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.046
All right, come on.

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.924
We'll play some blackjack.
Here we go.

00:09:53.634 --> 00:09:55.218
- Thirteen.
- Hit me.

00:09:55.469 --> 00:09:57.429
Ooh, 23.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:02.517
Which is what we play to
at this casino!

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:05.770
You win $10!

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.148
- I bet 20.
- Right.

00:10:13.362 --> 00:10:16.281
A new pair of shoes
for the Chan-Chan man!

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.867
Yes!

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.869
I've never seen a roll like this!

00:10:21.078 --> 00:10:22.329
That's right, baby!

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:23.872
What do I want now?

00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:28.168
Eight? Uh, six.

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:31.296
Pick a number!
That is your only job.

00:10:31.505 --> 00:10:32.756
- Eight.
- Thank you.

00:10:32.965 --> 00:10:35.800
If you get this,
we buy everybody a steak dinner.

00:10:39.096 --> 00:10:40.555
- Eight it is.
- Yes!

00:10:41.807 --> 00:10:43.808
We're not buying steak dinners, are we?

00:10:44.018 --> 00:10:45.685
- No.
- Okay, good.

00:10:47.021 --> 00:10:49.230
- What do I want now?
- Try a hard eight.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.940
- What?
- Two fours.

00:10:52.318 --> 00:10:54.069
Eight!

00:10:54.654 --> 00:10:57.656
Don't you let her go.
You're a lucky guy.

00:10:57.865 --> 00:11:00.075
Thank you, Mr. Drunken Gambler.

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:04.412
You get this, and, uh, we get
the biggest suite in the place.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.502
We get the biggest suite in the place.

00:11:10.711 --> 00:11:12.462
The biggest suite in the place!

00:11:12.672 --> 00:11:14.130
Come on!

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.051
I love you!
I can't remember why we fought.

00:11:18.302 --> 00:11:20.220
Because I had lunch with Rich...

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:21.763
Me neither!

00:11:22.473 --> 00:11:24.474
- What now?
- Uh, another hard eight.

00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:26.976
Hard eight? Let's call it easy eight!

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:30.522
I'll tell you what.
You roll another hard eight...

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.858
...and we get married here, tonight.

00:11:38.739 --> 00:11:40.323
Shut up!

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:45.203
It just got interesting!

00:11:51.168 --> 00:11:52.460
What did you say?

00:11:52.837 --> 00:11:55.714
You roll another eight,
we get married tonight.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:59.676
- You serious?
- Yes. I love you.

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:05.974
I've never loved anybody
as much as I love you.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:10.228
So if an eight comes up,
we take it as a sign and we do it.

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:12.522
What do you say?

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:13.940
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:16.317
Hard eight.

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:23.199
That's a four.
And where's the other one?

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:26.619
- Under the table.
- Nobody move!

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.414
You look that way, I look this way.

00:12:32.877 --> 00:12:34.294
Here it is, here it is.

00:12:36.046 --> 00:12:37.505
That could be 4 or 5.

00:12:40.593 --> 00:12:42.010
It's your call.

00:12:45.514 --> 00:12:47.223
It's a four.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.187
I think so too.

00:13:19.173 --> 00:13:21.633
Oh, well, lost again.

00:13:26.013 --> 00:13:28.348
That's it. You and me. Outside!

00:13:28.557 --> 00:13:32.101
I wouldn't want you to lose a chunk
of that pretty blond hair!

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.189
Oh!

00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:38.525
Be cool.

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:44.447
Okay, your lurking days are over.

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:48.326
- What?
- Everyone you lurk, I'll lurk first.

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:51.329
You move on,
I'll be one step ahead of you...

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:52.789
...every single time.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:56.668
And then I'll be on your ass
every hour of every day...

00:13:56.877 --> 00:13:58.461
...till Monday...

00:13:58.754 --> 00:14:01.047
...because that's when I go home.

00:14:01.757 --> 00:14:04.467
- When do you leave?
- Also Monday.

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:07.011
What time? Maybe we can share a cab.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.640
Hit me.

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:22.110
Hit me.

00:14:22.903 --> 00:14:24.195
We need more cards.

00:14:25.823 --> 00:14:29.242
Yeah, and we also need more, um, drinks.
Hold on a second.

00:14:32.788 --> 00:14:34.414
Hello, Vegas?

00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:37.792
We would like more alcohol.

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:40.962
You know what else?
We would like some more beers.

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:46.092
Oh, I forgot to dial.

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:52.849
That must be our alcohol and beers.

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:59.898
- Hey.
- It's Joey! I love Joey!

00:15:00.107 --> 00:15:01.733
Oh, I love Joey!

00:15:01.942 --> 00:15:03.234
Joey lives with a duck.

00:15:05.946 --> 00:15:07.822
Look, I need some help, okay?

00:15:08.073 --> 00:15:11.200
Someone has to convince
my hand twin to cooperate.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:16.331
I'll do it. Whatever you need
me to do, I'm your man.

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:21.002
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

00:15:21.211 --> 00:15:23.171
Are you okay?

00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:27.759
Yeah. Fine. Thanks.

00:15:30.888 --> 00:15:32.221
Hey, Rach?

00:15:32.473 --> 00:15:34.307
How you doing?

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.687
I'm doing good, baby.
How you doing?

00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:43.358
Don't let her drink anymore.

00:15:47.237 --> 00:15:51.032
Here's that macadamia nut.

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:54.953
- No, something else.
- Oops.

00:16:00.834 --> 00:16:02.710
So, what do you wanna do now?

00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.129
I wanna get out of the room.

00:16:06.882 --> 00:16:10.051
I really miss downstairs.

00:16:10.803 --> 00:16:15.348
Okay, you know what? There is only
one way I am leaving this hotel room.

00:16:17.267 --> 00:16:18.893
Well, hello!

00:16:20.104 --> 00:16:21.854
I'm Ross.

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:25.692
- Good luck to you.
- Sir, you've got a little something...

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.700
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:17:01.812 --> 00:17:04.689
I won! I won! I finally won!

00:17:04.898 --> 00:17:06.649
I won! That was my quarter!

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.985
Take a hike, toots.

00:17:10.487 --> 00:17:11.904
Excuse me, sir.

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:14.782
This lady played my quarter.
This is my money.

00:17:14.992 --> 00:17:16.284
Is that true, miss?

00:17:17.786 --> 00:17:20.663
- Sells drugs to kids.
- What?

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:23.541
She sells drugs to kids.

00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:26.878
It was my quarter.

00:17:27.087 --> 00:17:28.337
Was it her quarter?

00:17:29.048 --> 00:17:31.758
How about we talk
about this over dinner?

00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:35.720
- Okay, lady, you're out of here.
- No, you can't arrest me!

00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:38.014
I won't go back to that hellhole!

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:42.268
I'm just taking you outside.

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:43.978
Oh, okay.

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:52.945
I need something old, something new,
something borrowed and something blue.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:56.365
Here's something blue and new.

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:59.035
You are so efficient. I love you.

00:17:59.453 --> 00:18:00.703
- Let's go.
- No, wait!

00:18:00.954 --> 00:18:02.455
We need something old.

00:18:02.664 --> 00:18:06.501
I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was 12.

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.046
That'll work.

00:18:10.255 --> 00:18:11.923
I don't think so.

00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:15.593
Now something borrowed.

00:18:16.512 --> 00:18:20.098
- Here, just take this.
- That's stealing.

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:22.850
We'll bring it back.
Put it under your dress.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.401
Aw.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.489
Okay. One thing at a time.

00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:52.380
- Are you gonna play?
- No, I don't really have any money.

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:56.175
Not yet, anyway.

00:18:57.678 --> 00:18:59.387
Can't sit here if you don't play.

00:19:13.777 --> 00:19:17.530
Hello. My name is Regina Phalange.

00:19:19.366 --> 00:19:22.034
I'm a businesswoman
in town on business.

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:24.036
Would you like to see my card?

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.997
What did I do with my Filofax?

00:19:26.248 --> 00:19:28.457
I must've left it
in Conference Room B.

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:31.586
- Fourteen.
- Hit me.

00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:37.633
Oh, my God. May I just say that you
gentlemen have the exact same hands?

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:40.511
They're identical.

00:19:40.721 --> 00:19:43.431
I've never seen that
in the business world.

00:19:45.100 --> 00:19:46.809
Stop it.

00:19:47.728 --> 00:19:52.565
Miss Phalange, may I ask you a question
as an impartial person at this table?

00:19:52.774 --> 00:19:54.317
Please stop it.

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:59.155
Wouldn't you pay good money
to see identical hands...

00:19:59.406 --> 00:20:03.784
...showcased in some type
of an entertainment venue?

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:07.872
If you leave now, I will chop off
my hand and give it to you!

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.627
Didn't I just throw you out?

00:20:13.128 --> 00:20:14.962
No, you threw out Phoebe.

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:18.007
I'm Regina Phalange. Phalange.

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.384
Come on, lady.

00:20:20.594 --> 00:20:21.928
Please take him too.

00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:24.805
Me? Oh, come on, man.

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:26.265
Come on, buddy.

00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:29.393
Don't let him do this. Come on!

00:20:29.645 --> 00:20:32.271
I'm your hand twin!

00:20:36.526 --> 00:20:38.736
Hello. One marriage, please.

00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:40.404
We want to get married.

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:43.282
There's a service in progress.
Have a seat.

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:45.117
All right.

00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:55.253
What are you doing?

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:58.005
The "Wedding March."
Does that freak you out?

00:20:58.215 --> 00:21:00.091
No, it's the graduation song.

00:21:04.763 --> 00:21:06.222
Okay.

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:09.267
This is it. We're gonna get married.

00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:11.060
You sure you wanna do this?

00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:18.985
Hello, Mrs. Ross!

00:21:19.236 --> 00:21:22.321
Well, hello, Mr. Rachel!

00:21:24.491 --> 00:21:26.284
Wait. Okay.
