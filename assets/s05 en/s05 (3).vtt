WEBVTT

00:00:03.294 --> 00:00:04.420
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:08.924
Hi. Yeah, hi. I'm, um, Phoebe Buffay
and I have babies coming out.

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:11.635
Okay.
Have you started having contractions?

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.638
Not yet. Um, I heard they really hurt.
Do they?

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:17.433
- Well...
- Oh, my God.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.102
Which of you is the father?

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:23.313
None of them are.
The father is my brother.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:25.524
Okay.

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:29.403
I'll miss watching you
freak people out like that.

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:30.988
Pheebs...

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.824
This is for the babies
to look at someday.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.660
Do you want to say anything
before it starts?

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.120
Okay. Um...

00:00:38.413 --> 00:00:41.707
Hi, kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.127
Can't wait to see you.
Please don't hurt me.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:49.298
What took you so long?

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:51.717
Your cab left when ours did.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:58.223
We went back because
I forgot my jacket.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.688
You're not wearing one.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.067
Oh, man! I did it again!

00:01:09.486 --> 00:01:11.737
Someone has to call
Frank and Alice.

00:01:11.946 --> 00:01:14.156
My mom might...
What are you doing?

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.533
I've got to get the before shot.

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:13.340
We spoke to the nurse.
The reason your doctor is late...

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.592
...is because, uh, she's not coming.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.804
- What?
- She hit her head in the shower.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:22.432
Oh, my God. She's so stupid!

00:02:22.851 --> 00:02:24.768
Pheebs, it's going to be okay.

00:02:24.978 --> 00:02:28.772
I don't see three kids
coming out of your vagina.

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:35.404
Listen. The nurse said
the doctor is wonderful.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.489
He's head of the department.

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.325
All right. Ooh. Oh, dear God, save me.

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.661
I'm having my first contraction.

00:02:43.413 --> 00:02:44.955
- Oh, it's not bad.
- Okay.

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:50.502
And so the miracle of birth begins.
And I...

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:52.921
You okay?

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:55.257
Something hurts.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:58.343
Ooh, it's sympathy pains.
Oh, that's so sweet.

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:00.888
I didn't know I cared that much.

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:04.892
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:08.770
I'm Dr. Harad.
I'll be delivering your babies.

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:12.357
You'll be in good hands.
I've been doing this a long time.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.985
I'll be back to do your internal.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.404
Just relax, everything looks great.

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:20.199
And also, I love Fonzie.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:26.079
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?

00:03:26.331 --> 00:03:28.123
That's what it sounded like.

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:30.000
All right.

00:03:31.711 --> 00:03:33.378
Hey!

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:37.382
Am I late?
Nobody came out yet, right?

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.385
No, we haven't started yet.
Where's Alice?

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:43.972
Uh, Delaware. Until she gets here,
I'll be your coach.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.184
Don't worry. She told me
about the LaMazda stuff.

00:03:48.102 --> 00:03:50.646
If you get the babies out
by month's end...

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.731
...you get two percent financing.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.441
Yeah.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.572
Monica, you're going to be
very proud of me.

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:04.409
I just got us dates with two
unbelievably cute nurses.

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:05.953
Oh, my.

00:04:07.372 --> 00:04:09.206
They're male nurses.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:11.291
Heh, heh. Not in my head.

00:04:12.001 --> 00:04:15.671
They want to take us out Saturday night.
What do you say?

00:04:15.838 --> 00:04:18.715
Um...

00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.387
- I don't think so.
- What?

00:04:23.638 --> 00:04:25.097
What are you talking about?

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:29.059
You've been telling me to
get over Ross and move on.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.395
I'm moving on and so are you.

00:04:31.604 --> 00:04:33.105
Why don't you want to go?

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.399
Um...

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:38.151
Why don't you give me
a good reason...

00:04:38.361 --> 00:04:40.696
...and I'll tell you if it's true.

00:04:42.407 --> 00:04:45.284
- What?
- Harder than it sounds, isn't it?

00:04:45.994 --> 00:04:48.453
You're coming.
And when they get off...

00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:51.039
...we'll go get some Jello with them.

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.751
Yep. There's always room for Jello.

00:04:58.172 --> 00:05:00.132
How do you make that dirty?

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.968
It's easy.
I can do it with anything.

00:05:03.928 --> 00:05:06.763
Grandma's chicken salad...

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:15.605
Ross!

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.025
Get a shot of this.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.570
Hey, babies, these are the headlines
when you were born.

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:25.532
Now girl baby, turn away.
And boy babies...

00:05:25.783 --> 00:05:27.409
...check it out.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:30.871
This is what naked women
looked like when you were born.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.665
Now let's dive into the good stuff.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:37.669
Okay, I'm having another one.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:40.756
This one doesn't hurt eith...
Ooh, yes, it does! Ow.

00:05:41.132 --> 00:05:43.050
Ow, ow, ow!

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:45.385
Ooh.

00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:48.555
Ooh, I was kind of hoping that was it.

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:53.518
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:56.730
A couple of nurses asked them out.
Maybe they're with them.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:58.357
Really? Male nurses?

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:00.567
Yeah, I was bummed too.

00:06:01.903 --> 00:06:03.737
So they're going on dates?

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:05.572
- When?
- I think Saturday.

00:06:08.117 --> 00:06:10.786
- What's with him?
- Um, sympathy pains.

00:06:11.245 --> 00:06:15.582
It was sweet at first, but now I think
he's trying to steal my thunder.

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.043
Okay.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.087
Let's see what we got here.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.924
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.428
This Fonzie person you
keep referring to...

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:30.722
...is that another doctor?

00:06:30.932 --> 00:06:31.973
Oh, no, no.

00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:34.976
Fonzie is the nickname of
Arthur Fonzerelli.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.437
The Fonz.

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:41.191
All right.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:42.943
Soon.

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:47.489
It's not that weird, is it?

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.449
It's very weird.

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:54.371
I don't want some guy down there
telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."

00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:59.584
He doesn't seem to be
impersonating Fonzie...

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:00.961
What are you doing?

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.674
Why are you defending him?
Just get me another doctor...

00:07:05.883 --> 00:07:07.926
...who isn't crazy
and doesn't Fonzie!

00:07:08.594 --> 00:07:10.679
- Again, it's not...
- Aah! Aah!

00:07:17.311 --> 00:07:18.854
Hey, there you are.

00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:21.523
Um, there's something you should know.

00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:24.734
Is this about you dating the nurse?
Joey told me.

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:28.613
I am so fine.
You and I, we're just, nothing.

00:07:28.781 --> 00:07:31.283
Just goofing around.

00:07:34.036 --> 00:07:37.998
Um, I was about to tell you
I was getting out of it.

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:42.085
But, um, if we're just "goofing around,"
maybe I will go out with him.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:44.379
Fine. Maybe I will too.

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:49.468
Hey! Look what I found
in the gift shop...

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:52.971
Oh. Get up! Get up! Get up!

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.186
Okay, Pheebs?

00:07:59.479 --> 00:08:01.104
This is Dr. Oberman.

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:04.232
He has no strong feelings
about Fonzie...

00:08:04.442 --> 00:08:07.569
...or any of the Happy Days gang.

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:10.655
You're going into what grade?

00:08:11.824 --> 00:08:15.410
I'm actually a first-year resident.
I graduated early.

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:16.786
Uh-huh. Me too.

00:08:16.954 --> 00:08:21.583
Ross, I should have specified
I'd need a grown-up doctor.

00:08:22.376 --> 00:08:24.044
Really, I'm fully qualified...

00:08:24.253 --> 00:08:25.295
Shh, Doogie. Shh.

00:08:27.882 --> 00:08:32.177
Doesn't anybody understand that
I'm going to be having babies soon? Huh?

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:34.804
Go, little boy! Go!

00:08:38.684 --> 00:08:41.019
Oh, cool. You made him cry!

00:08:45.983 --> 00:08:50.320
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid
you've got kidney stones.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.906
Uh, well, what else could it be?

00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:55.116
It's kidney stones.

00:08:56.077 --> 00:08:57.118
Or...

00:08:57.328 --> 00:08:58.912
Kidney stones.

00:09:03.459 --> 00:09:04.793
You're getting there.

00:09:05.002 --> 00:09:07.254
These babies are very, very lucky.

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:08.505
They are? Why?

00:09:08.756 --> 00:09:11.841
They'll be born
on the Fonz's half-birthday.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.971
Happy birthday.

00:09:16.514 --> 00:09:18.473
Just to clarify.

00:09:18.683 --> 00:09:20.350
I'm not Fonzie.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:24.646
Yeah.

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.488
It's a terrific thing that you're having
these babies for Frank and Alice.

00:09:33.698 --> 00:09:35.365
- I know, it is.
- Yeah.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.076
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.996
I want to keep one.

00:09:45.876 --> 00:09:47.877
Oh, I'm going to be on the news.

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:52.882
You've gotta be kidding.

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.719
You know you can't keep
one of these babies.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:57.929
Maybe I can. You don't know.

00:09:58.139 --> 00:10:02.183
I do. Frank and Alice will
want to keep all their children.

00:10:02.393 --> 00:10:04.811
Maybe not. You know?

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:07.355
Three babies are a handful.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.816
Maybe they'll want to unload one.

00:10:11.569 --> 00:10:15.572
I hate to miss an opportunity
because I didn't ask.

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.951
Phoebe, no. This is insane.

00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:21.286
Just ask him.

00:10:21.495 --> 00:10:23.204
What? Me?

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:24.414
I can't ask him!

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:27.959
Do you know how inappropriate
that would be?

00:10:29.295 --> 00:10:31.796
All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank.

00:10:32.006 --> 00:10:33.298
Just feel him out.

00:10:33.549 --> 00:10:37.135
No. I will not ask Frank
to give you one of his kids.

00:10:39.055 --> 00:10:40.096
You're right.

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:47.854
Tell him it's for you.

00:10:50.274 --> 00:10:51.816
Feeling better, sweetie?

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:53.818
Maybe a little.

00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:55.820
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:58.615
Me too.

00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:03.203
Hey. I just heard. What's up?

00:11:03.412 --> 00:11:05.288
Kidney stones.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:12.545
Ordinarily, we try to break
the stones up with shock waves.

00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.131
But they're too close to the bladder.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:19.427
Either we wait for you to pass them
or else go up the urethra...

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:20.637
Whoa!

00:11:22.598 --> 00:11:25.850
No, no, no.
Nothing is going "up," okay?

00:11:26.018 --> 00:11:30.522
"Up" is not an option.
What's a urethra?

00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:34.901
Are you crazy?

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:40.031
Did you ask him?

00:11:40.282 --> 00:11:42.158
No, I haven't had a chance yet.

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:44.035
I'm kind of on a clock here.

00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:48.498
Oh, Fonzie.

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:54.421
You know who I always liked? Mork.

00:11:58.050 --> 00:11:59.592
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:03.596
Fonzie met Mork.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:05.765
Mork froze Fonzie.

00:12:06.767 --> 00:12:08.935
Yeah...

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:10.729
Yes...

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:14.149
...but Fonzie was already cool.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.236
So he wasn't hurt. Right?

00:12:19.321 --> 00:12:20.697
Yeah, that's right.

00:12:23.784 --> 00:12:25.201
How you doing?

00:12:25.453 --> 00:12:27.871
Okay. Doctor says any minute now.

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.624
You know, Alice is going
to be here so soon.

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:36.755
You couldn't just do me a favor
and, like, hold them in?

00:12:38.466 --> 00:12:42.093
Sorry, I'm in the middle
of the last favor you asked me to do.

00:12:43.637 --> 00:12:45.722
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi!

00:12:46.056 --> 00:12:49.768
This is Dan, one of the guys
we're going out with on Saturday.

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:51.269
Dan, Monica.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:52.604
Nice to meet you.

00:12:54.273 --> 00:12:55.857
Hello, Dan.

00:12:56.859 --> 00:13:00.820
I'm really looking forward
to Saturday night. Really! Really!

00:13:03.991 --> 00:13:05.283
So Dan...

00:13:05.493 --> 00:13:07.494
Nurse, not a doctor, huh?

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.662
Kind of girlie, isn't it?

00:13:12.541 --> 00:13:14.167
- Chandler.
- That's okay.

00:13:14.335 --> 00:13:17.086
I'm doing this to
get through medical school.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:19.380
Oh.

00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:22.926
And it didn't feel "girlie"
during the Gulf War.

00:13:23.344 --> 00:13:24.594
Sure.

00:13:28.516 --> 00:13:31.267
Thanks for doing that for us,
by the way.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.981
Why wait till Saturday?
Are you free tomorrow?

00:13:37.191 --> 00:13:39.067
Sure.
I'll get somebody to cover me.

00:13:39.276 --> 00:13:40.860
Aw, great.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.029
Hey, you and me, Saturday night?

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:45.240
- No.
- All right, very good!

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:50.036
This is a big one.

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:55.458
Unh! Get these things out of me!

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:59.671
Breathe! Breathe through the pain.

00:14:02.758 --> 00:14:04.884
I want the drugs, Ross!

00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:07.762
I do too! I do too!

00:14:10.766 --> 00:14:13.810
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye.

00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:15.895
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:14:16.105 --> 00:14:19.023
That was Alice's mom.
Alice left five hours ago.

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:20.567
She should be here.

00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:22.485
She'll make it on time.

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:24.445
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:14:24.655 --> 00:14:26.573
So Frank...

00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:30.118
Three babies.
Whoo, that just seems like a lot, huh?

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.161
Not to me.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:35.123
Fair enough.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.423
You're at 10 centimeters.
Time to start having babies.

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:45.383
I want only the father here.

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:48.011
- We love you.
- Good luck.

00:14:48.929 --> 00:14:50.680
- Bye, Dan!
- Uh, bye, Monica.

00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:58.021
I need a clamp, a sterile towel
and Channel 31.

00:14:58.188 --> 00:14:59.230
What is that?

00:15:03.611 --> 00:15:04.652
Oh, my God!

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:08.239
Oh, no, no! It's a good one.
Fonzie plays the bongos.

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:11.492
Ready? Time to try pushing.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:13.578
Ready? Time to try peeing.

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:22.086
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's almost time to try peeing.

00:15:24.381 --> 00:15:26.424
Push. Concentrate on pushing.

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:28.301
I see the head.

00:15:28.552 --> 00:15:30.345
Yes, it is a head!

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.348
Keep pushing. Come on.

00:15:33.557 --> 00:15:35.892
I can't believe somebody's coming out!

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:38.478
There's somebody coming out of you!

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:40.229
It's my son!

00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:41.856
All right.

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:45.485
Here's your first baby.

00:15:48.322 --> 00:15:49.697
Yes!

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:51.699
Yes! We got a baby boy!

00:15:53.535 --> 00:15:55.536
Frank Junior, Junior!

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:57.455
How does he look?

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.040
So gross!

00:16:02.544 --> 00:16:04.504
Okay. You ready to push again?

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:07.048
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.

00:16:07.257 --> 00:16:10.593
Come on, you can do it.
You can do it.

00:16:18.352 --> 00:16:19.769
Yeah!

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:23.106
Little Leslie's here!
We got another one!

00:16:23.983 --> 00:16:27.485
Oh, my God! I can't believe
I have two children.

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.405
How scary is that?

00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:38.579
Come on, little Chandler,
it's time to be born.

00:16:39.456 --> 00:16:41.541
He's coming! Yes, he's coming!

00:16:46.005 --> 00:16:47.922
Hey, where's his thing?

00:16:52.136 --> 00:16:53.678
Chandler's a girl!

00:16:55.681 --> 00:16:58.141
Oh, God. Kindergarten flashback.

00:16:59.476 --> 00:17:03.146
They read the sonogram wrong,
because they thought it was a boy.

00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:05.440
But Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!

00:17:05.649 --> 00:17:07.316
Okay, keep saying it.

00:17:08.777 --> 00:17:11.779
- Am I too late?
- No, no. Everything's okay.

00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:14.407
There's 30 fingers and 30 toes.

00:17:14.908 --> 00:17:16.075
We have our babies?

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.452
Yeah.

00:17:18.412 --> 00:17:19.579
We have our babies.

00:17:34.511 --> 00:17:36.095
Oh, my God.

00:17:36.305 --> 00:17:37.722
You did it, man.

00:17:39.058 --> 00:17:40.892
Would you like to see them?

00:17:44.521 --> 00:17:46.522
They're so small.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:55.907
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Great.

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:03.206
Are you really going to date
that nurse man?

00:18:04.083 --> 00:18:06.417
You and I are just "goofing around."

00:18:06.627 --> 00:18:09.253
I thought, why not
"goof around" with him?

00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:16.344
I don't know if you've looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:18.221
Well, I have...

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:22.183
...and the technical definition is:

00:18:22.684 --> 00:18:26.729
"Two friends who care a lot
about each other...

00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:30.274
...and have amazing sex...

00:18:32.903 --> 00:18:36.405
...and just want to spend
more time together."

00:18:37.366 --> 00:18:41.327
But if you have this new
dictionary that gets you mad at me...

00:18:41.537 --> 00:18:44.247
...then we have to get you
my original dictionary.

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:48.793
I am so bad at this.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.256
- You're better than you think you are.
- Really?

00:18:53.423 --> 00:18:54.924
Okay. So if...

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:58.261
- Know when to stop.
- I sensed that I should stop.

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.931
- So we're okay?
- Yeah.

00:19:02.099 --> 00:19:04.934
I'm gonna go tell Dan that
it's not going to happen.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.356
- Don't do the dance.
- Right.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:16.737
You're my favorite.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:19.949
- Which one do you have?
- I don't care.

00:19:21.618 --> 00:19:22.660
Hi.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.203
Hey.

00:19:24.621 --> 00:19:28.082
Frank and Alice want me to tell you
they're making phone calls.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:31.627
Did you talk to them
about, you know...

00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:35.256
Yeah, um...

00:19:35.883 --> 00:19:37.925
No, honey.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.261
Oh, okay.

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:44.140
It was a long shot.

00:19:46.935 --> 00:19:50.605
You guys? Can I just have
a second alone with the babies?

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:52.523
Yeah.

00:20:13.587 --> 00:20:15.630
So here you are.

00:20:16.673 --> 00:20:20.426
Seems like yesterday I was talking
to you in that petri dish.

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:29.477
Everyone said labor
was the hardest thing.

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:31.687
But they were wrong. This is.

00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:38.152
Well, I had the most fun with you guys.

00:20:39.404 --> 00:20:42.531
I wish I could take you home
and see you every day.

00:20:45.827 --> 00:20:48.579
I'll settle for being your favorite aunt.

00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:54.001
I know Alice's sister has a pool,
but you lived in me.

00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:01.509
Okay, so we're cool.

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:04.637
We're going to be great.

00:21:06.348 --> 00:21:07.556
Little high-fives.

00:21:07.724 --> 00:21:09.725
Aah, aah, aah.

00:21:18.193 --> 00:21:20.278
Well, if you're going to cry...

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:39.797
Phoebe, we are so proud of you.
You're amazing!

00:21:40.007 --> 00:21:41.132
I know.

00:21:43.051 --> 00:21:45.177
Does it hurt as bad as they say?

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.471
You won't be able to take it.

00:21:49.182 --> 00:21:52.685
Now that little Chandler is a girl,
what'll they name her?

00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:54.437
They'll call her Chandler.

00:21:55.397 --> 00:21:58.232
Kind of a masculine name,
don't you think?

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:00.901
It works on you.
