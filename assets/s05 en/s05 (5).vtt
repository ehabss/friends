WEBVTT

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:15.139
- Hey.
- Hey, ha, ha.

00:00:21.771 --> 00:00:23.313
Monica?

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:25.983
What time is it?

00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.235
Uh, 9.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:31.405
But it's dark out.

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:34.783
Um, well, that's because you always
sleep till noon, silly.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.746
This is what 9 looks like.

00:00:39.831 --> 00:00:42.249
I guess I'll get washed up then.

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.877
Watch that sunrise.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.174
I'm really getting tired of
sneaking around all the time.

00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:54.636
I know, me too. Hey, what if we went away
for the whole weekend? No interruptions.

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:56.930
And we could be naked the entire time.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.557
All weekend?

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:00.434
- That's a whole lot of naked.
- Mm-hm.

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:05.064
Yeah, I could say I have a conference
and you can say you have a chef thing.

00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:08.275
Oh, I've always wanted to go
to this culinary fair in Jersey!

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:10.611
Ha, ha, okay.
You know you're not, though.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.946
- Right. Okay.
- Let's go.

00:01:13.114 --> 00:01:15.657
Wait. What about Joey?

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:11.839
Hey, guess what I'm doing this weekend.

00:02:12.006 --> 00:02:13.966
Going to this culinary fair in Jersey.

00:02:14.134 --> 00:02:18.887
How weird! Chandler just told us
he's got a conference there. Huh.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:23.350
Oh, that's funny, ha, ha. Seems like
Chandler's conference could've been...

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:25.435
...in Connecticut or Vermont.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:31.275
I'm not in charge of where
the conference is held.

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:35.320
Do you want people to think it's
a fake conference? It's a real conference.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.281
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:02:37.448 --> 00:02:40.325
- Is Rachel here? I gotta talk to her.
- No, she's out shopping.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:43.579
- Damn.
- What's going on?

00:02:44.122 --> 00:02:45.831
I told Emily to come.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:50.002
And I just need to, you know,
talk to Rachel about it.

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:53.005
Wait a minute.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.383
So when Emily comes,
you're not gonna see Rachel anymore?

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:59.636
I'm focusing on the
"I get to see my wife" part, all right...

00:02:59.804 --> 00:03:02.347
...and not on the part
that makes me do this, huh?

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.897
So you'll never be in the same room together?
How is that even gonna work?

00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:12.566
I have no idea. I mean...

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.736
But I assure you, I will figure it out.

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:20.365
It doesn't seem like it's gonna work.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.493
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

00:03:23.661 --> 00:03:24.912
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:26.371
What's going on?

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:29.875
We're flipping Monica's mattress.

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:36.548
So I'm thinking, basically,
we pick it up, and then we flip it.

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.219
That's better than my way.

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:44.514
Oh, hey, guys, would you flip mine too?

00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:46.850
- Oh, man.
- Oh.

00:03:49.562 --> 00:03:52.189
Oh, look! A letter from my mom.

00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:56.610
So, Rach?

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.946
You know how Emily's coming, right?

00:03:59.155 --> 00:04:00.822
Oh, yeah. I know.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.157
Can you hear anything?

00:04:02.325 --> 00:04:05.035
Oh, yeah, somebody just said,
"Can you hear anything?"

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.001
Hey, Joey's ass.

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:16.463
What are you doing?

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:19.424
Remember when they got
in that big fight and broke up...

00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.427
...and we were all stuck in here
all night with no food?

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:26.598
Well, when Ross said "Rachel" at the wedding,
I figured it was gonna happen again.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:28.642
You know? So I hid this in here.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.937
Ooh, candy bars, crossword puzzles...

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:34.314
Ooh, Mad Libs. Mine!

00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:37.359
Condoms?

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:43.031
Hey, you don't know how long
we're gonna be in here.

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.367
We may have to re-populate the Earth.

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.788
And condoms are the way to do that?

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:56.169
Anyway, it all boils down to this.

00:04:56.337 --> 00:05:00.924
- The last time I talked to Emily...
- Aah! Oh, my God! Our dog died!

00:05:02.218 --> 00:05:06.847
- What?
- Oh, my God. LaPooh, our dog!

00:05:07.015 --> 00:05:09.683
LaPooh's still alive?

00:05:09.892 --> 00:05:14.688
Oh! It says he was hit by
an ice-cream truck and dragged for...

00:05:14.856 --> 00:05:18.692
...19 blocks!

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.155
- Oh! Oh, my God.
- Sweetie, we heard you crying.

00:05:23.364 --> 00:05:26.199
- Please don't cry.
- It's LaPooh!

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:28.744
I know, it's LaPooh right now
but it'll get better.

00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:39.087
I can't believe it! We're here!

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.758
Ooh, chocolates on the pillows!
Oh, I love that!

00:05:42.925 --> 00:05:45.844
You should live with Joey.
Rolos everywhere.

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:51.099
- Oh. Okay, I'll be right back.
- Okay.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:57.105
Oh, yes!

00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:00.567
Monica, get in here.
It's a high-speed car chase on!

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.611
We're switching rooms.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.780
Oh, dear God, they gave us glasses!

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.533
No, they gave us glasses
with lipstick on them.

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:12.204
If they didn't change the glasses,
who knows what else they didn't change.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:16.541
Oh, come on, sweetie. I just want
this weekend to be perfect, okay?

00:06:16.751 --> 00:06:18.960
- We can change rooms, can't we?
- Okay.

00:06:19.504 --> 00:06:23.423
Okay, but let's do it now, though,
because Chopper 5 just lost its feed!

00:06:28.012 --> 00:06:30.097
Hey, so, uh...

00:06:30.264 --> 00:06:33.266
You know how there was something
I wanted to talk to you about?

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.227
Oh, yeah.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.354
Well...

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.731
...you know I'm trying to work
things out with Emily.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.775
Mm-hm.

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:43.693
Well, there's this...

00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:45.821
...one thing.

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:49.616
Okay, here goes.

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.747
I made a promise that... Oh, hey.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.958
- What?
- Your nose is bleeding.

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:00.252
- Oh, God!
- You're bleeding.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.628
Ah. Ah, not again.

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.755
This happened when my grandfather died.

00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.924
It's... Ugh, sorry.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.801
Oh, gross, unh.

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:11.721
Okay. So I'm sorry.
What did you wanna tell me?

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:16.518
- Um...
- Ugh.

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.022
Sorry. Sorry.

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.899
Okay.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.360
I, uh...

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:28.029
I can't see you anymore.

00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:31.783
Yeah, I know, it's ridiculous.
I can't see you, either.

00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:36.246
I think you'll find this room
more to your liking.

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:37.664
Okay, great.

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.753
They say he's only got half a tank left.

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:48.383
Half a tank? We still got a lot
of high-speed chasing to do!

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:51.636
- We're switching rooms again.
- What? Why?

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.599
This is a garden-view room
and we paid for an ocean-view room.

00:07:55.808 --> 00:08:00.979
Our last ocean-view room
was unacceptable to you.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.983
Excuse me. Um, can I talk to you
over here for just a second?

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.651
Uh-huh.

00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:11.865
- Chandler.
- Yeah?

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:15.744
Look, these clowns are trying to
take us for a ride. I won't let them.

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:17.871
We're not a couple of suckers.

00:08:19.081 --> 00:08:20.248
I hear you, Mugsy.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.752
But, look, all these rooms are fine.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.546
Okay? Can you just pick one
so I can watch the...

00:08:26.714 --> 00:08:30.509
Have a perfect, magical
weekend together with you?

00:08:34.555 --> 00:08:36.431
- Okay, this one I like.
- Nothing.

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:38.099
Nothing. It's over.

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:41.728
Damn it, this is regularly scheduled
programming!

00:08:42.813 --> 00:08:44.648
Can we turn the TV off, okay?

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:47.275
Do we really wanna spend
the weekend like this?

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:50.695
I'm sorry, am I getting in the way
of all the room-switching fun?

00:08:50.863 --> 00:08:54.032
- Ha, ha, don't blame me for ruining tonight.
- Who should I blame?

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.868
The nice bellman who had to drag
our luggage to 10 rooms?

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.037
Or the idiot who thought
he could drive...

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:02.541
...from Albany to Canada
on a half a tank of gas?

00:09:03.584 --> 00:09:05.961
Do not speak ill of the dead.

00:09:07.547 --> 00:09:11.758
We're supposed to be spending
a romantic weekend together.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:13.176
What's the matter with you?

00:09:13.344 --> 00:09:16.096
I just wanna watch a little television.
What's the big deal?

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:17.973
Jeez, relax, Mom.

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:22.143
What did you say?

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:26.106
I said, "Jeez, relax, Mon."

00:09:35.741 --> 00:09:37.367
Hey.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:43.707
Rachel, I've been wanting to tell you something
and I just have to get it out.

00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.500
Okay. All right. What's up?

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:48.295
Okay.

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:54.342
You know how you told me I should do
whatever it takes to fix my marriage?

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.721
Yeah, I told you to give Emily
whatever she wants.

00:09:58.723 --> 00:10:04.519
And while that was good advice,
you should know that what she wants...

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.147
Yeah?

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:11.735
...is for me not to see you anymore.

00:10:13.904 --> 00:10:18.742
Well, that's crazy. You can't do that.
What are you gonna tell her?

00:10:24.123 --> 00:10:26.333
Oh, my God.

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:29.377
Oh, you've already agreed to this,
haven't you?

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:32.672
It's awful, I know. Uh, it's... Heh.

00:10:32.882 --> 00:10:36.676
I mean, I feel terrible, but I have to do this
if I want my marriage to work.

00:10:36.844 --> 00:10:41.389
And I do. I have to make
this marriage work. I have to.

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:49.230
But the good thing is, we can still
see each other until she gets here.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:52.150
Oh!

00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:57.489
Oh, lucky me! Oh, my God!
That is good news, Ross!

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:01.159
I think that's the best news I've heard
since LaPooh died!

00:11:03.996 --> 00:11:09.042
You have no idea what a nightmare
this has been. Uh, this is so hard.

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.544
Oh, yeah, really? Is it, Ross?

00:11:11.712 --> 00:11:15.632
- Well, let me make this a little easier for you.
- What are you doing?

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.967
- Storming out.
- Rachel, this is your apartment.

00:11:18.135 --> 00:11:20.970
Yeah? Well, that's how mad I am!

00:11:34.985 --> 00:11:37.112
Damn Rolos!

00:11:38.572 --> 00:11:39.781
- Hey, you're back.
- Hey.

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:41.282
How was your conference?

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:45.662
It was terrible. I fought with
my colleagues for the entire time.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:48.164
Are you kidding with this?

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:50.709
Uh, so your weekend was a bust?

00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:54.295
Uh, no, I got to see Donald Trump
waiting for an elevator.

00:11:56.132 --> 00:11:57.841
- Hi.
- Hey, you're back too.

00:11:58.008 --> 00:12:01.010
Yeah. Um, Chandler,
could I talk to you outside for a second?

00:12:01.178 --> 00:12:04.180
- How was your chef thing?
- Ugh. It was awful.

00:12:04.348 --> 00:12:07.058
I guess some people don't
appreciate really good food.

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.978
Maybe it was the kind of food
that tasted good at first...

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:13.273
...but then made everybody vomit
and have diarrhea.

00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:18.236
- Chandler.
- Monica.

00:12:21.323 --> 00:12:23.825
I wanna know how much the room was.
I'll pay my half.

00:12:23.993 --> 00:12:25.118
Okay, fine. $300.

00:12:25.286 --> 00:12:28.663
- Three hundred dollars?
- Yeah. Just think of it as $25 per room.

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:34.961
What are you guys woofing about?

00:12:35.421 --> 00:12:37.130
Chandler stole a 20 from my purse!

00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:39.758
No!

00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:44.429
You know what?
Now that I think about it...

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.807
...I constantly find myself
without 20s, and you...

00:12:47.975 --> 00:12:49.934
...always have lots.

00:12:55.232 --> 00:12:57.484
You should've seen the look on her face.

00:12:57.651 --> 00:13:01.237
I don't want Rachel to hate me.
I don't know what to do.

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:03.573
- You want my advice?
- Yes. Please.

00:13:03.741 --> 00:13:06.701
- You're not gonna like it.
- That's okay.

00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:09.788
You got married too fast.

00:13:11.165 --> 00:13:13.541
- That's not advice.
- I told you.

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:18.922
I'm going to the bathroom.

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:24.677
Man, if anyone asked me to give up
any of you, I don't think I could do it.

00:13:24.845 --> 00:13:25.887
Me neither.

00:13:26.388 --> 00:13:27.847
Maybe I could do it.

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.353
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:36.356
I know you guys heard about
the whole thing with me and Ross.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:41.027
But I've been obsessing about it all day
and would love not to talk about it.

00:13:41.195 --> 00:13:43.404
Uh, I don't know if this falls
under that category...

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:46.658
...but, uh, Ross is right back there.

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:49.452
- That's not Ross.
- Oh, no, not that guy.

00:13:49.662 --> 00:13:51.579
He does look like him, though.

00:13:52.623 --> 00:13:54.916
Okay. Ross is in the bathroom.

00:13:55.084 --> 00:13:59.128
Oh, my God. It's happening.
It's already started. I'm Kip.

00:13:59.296 --> 00:14:01.548
- What?
- Yeah, you're not Kip.

00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:03.216
Do you even know who Kip is?

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:07.387
Who cares? You're Rachel.

00:14:09.557 --> 00:14:11.266
Who's Kip?

00:14:11.433 --> 00:14:14.060
Kip, my old roommate.
We all hung out together.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:16.771
- Oh, that poor bastard.
- Mm-hm.

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:20.525
See? You told me the story.
He and Monica dated.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.944
They broke up,
they couldn't be in the same room.

00:14:23.112 --> 00:14:24.946
You all promised you'd stay his friend.

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.782
And what happened? He got phased out.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.660
- You're not gonna be phased out.
- Well, of course I am.

00:14:30.828 --> 00:14:34.706
It won't happen to Ross. He's your
brother, your old college roommate.

00:14:34.874 --> 00:14:37.917
It was a matter of time
before someone had to leave the group.

00:14:38.085 --> 00:14:39.878
I always assumed Phoebe
would be the one to go.

00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:45.466
Honey, come on, you live far away,
you're not related.

00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:47.135
You lift right out.

00:14:53.434 --> 00:14:54.934
Hey.

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:57.186
Hey, Mr. Bing.

00:14:57.354 --> 00:15:00.773
That, uh, hotel you stayed at called.

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:04.235
Said someone left an eyelash curler
in your room.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.823
Yes, that was mine.

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:13.119
I figured you hooked up with some girl
and she left it.

00:15:13.662 --> 00:15:15.997
Yes, that would have made more sense.

00:15:17.082 --> 00:15:20.043
You know, I don't even feel like
I know you anymore, man.

00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:24.839
All right, uh, look, I'm just gonna
ask you this one time, all right?

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:27.592
And whatever you say,
I'll believe you.

00:15:28.469 --> 00:15:31.471
Were you or were you not...

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:33.097
...on a gay cruise?

00:15:47.404 --> 00:15:48.446
Phoebe.

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:55.078
I'm sorry about
the whole lifting-out thing.

00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.040
You gotta come with me.

00:15:59.208 --> 00:16:00.833
- Come where?
- Wherever I go.

00:16:01.001 --> 00:16:04.420
Come on, you and me, we'll start
a new group. We're the best ones.

00:16:08.676 --> 00:16:11.594
Okay, but try to get Joey too.

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:17.767
Pheebs, do you mind
if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec?

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:20.019
Oh, sure, yeah.

00:16:22.189 --> 00:16:23.398
Bye, Ross.

00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:25.775
Forever.

00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:30.238
- Ahem.
- Hi.

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:31.489
Hi.

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:34.617
What are you doing here?
Isn't this against the rules?

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:38.454
I talked to Monica.

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:43.793
Look, I'm the one who made the choice.

00:16:43.961 --> 00:16:46.796
I'm the one who's making things change.

00:16:46.964 --> 00:16:50.341
So I should be the one to,
you know, step back.

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:53.594
- Oh, Ross...
- No, no, it's okay. Really.

00:16:53.762 --> 00:16:56.556
Plenty of people just see
their sisters at Thanksgiving...

00:16:56.724 --> 00:17:00.601
...and just see their college roommates
at reunions...

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:03.855
...and just see Joey at Burger King.

00:17:08.652 --> 00:17:09.902
So is that better?

00:17:13.532 --> 00:17:15.992
No, it's not better.

00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:19.037
I still don't get to see you.

00:17:21.457 --> 00:17:25.293
Well, what would you do, Rach?
If you were me, what would you do?

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:33.384
Well...

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:37.138
...for starters, I would have said
the right name at my wedding.

00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:46.147
I can't believe this is happening.

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:51.611
I know.

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.906
I am so sorry.

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.326
I know that too.

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:07.418
Ahem. Hey, Rach?

00:18:07.628 --> 00:18:12.048
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, Phoebe said
you wanted to talk to me about a trip.

00:18:17.554 --> 00:18:20.723
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:23.601
I just came over to drop off...

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.520
...nothing.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.109
So that weekend kind of sucked, huh?

00:18:31.902 --> 00:18:33.111
Yeah, it did.

00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:35.905
So I guess this is over?

00:18:37.282 --> 00:18:39.867
- What?
- Well, you know, you and me.

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:41.744
I mean, it had to end sometime.

00:18:42.746 --> 00:18:44.247
Why exactly?

00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:46.833
Because of the weekend. We had a fight.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.502
Chandler, that's crazy.

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:53.089
Ha, ha. If you give up every time
you have a fight with someone...

00:18:53.257 --> 00:18:56.050
...you'd never be with anyone
longer than...

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.512
Oh.

00:19:03.183 --> 00:19:04.517
So this isn't over?

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.563
You are so cute!

00:19:10.941 --> 00:19:13.651
No, no. It was a fight.

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:18.156
You deal with it and you move on.
It's nothing to freak out about.

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:21.826
- Really? Okay, great.
- Heh.

00:19:22.202 --> 00:19:24.996
Aw. Welcome to an adult relationship.

00:19:28.917 --> 00:19:30.251
We're in a relationship?

00:19:33.463 --> 00:19:36.507
- I'm afraid so.
- Okay.

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:43.598
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:47.143
Oh, hey, Monica, I heard you saw
Donald Trump at your convention.

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:49.395
Yeah, saw him waiting for an elevator.

00:19:52.649 --> 00:19:55.234
Rach, can I borrow your eyelash curler?
I lost mine.

00:19:55.402 --> 00:19:57.361
Yeah, it's in the bathroom.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:03.951
Oh! Oh!

00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:06.120
- Joey, can I talk to you for a second?
- Ooh, oh!

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.873
- Joey, I need to talk to you.
- Oh! Oh!

00:20:09.082 --> 00:20:11.000
Oh, oh, oh!

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:23.221
Yes.

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:27.183
You? And you?

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:30.353
Yes, but you cannot tell anyone.
No one knows.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.355
But how? When?

00:20:32.856 --> 00:20:35.233
- It happened in London.
- In London!

00:20:37.861 --> 00:20:41.697
The reason we didn't tell anyone was
we didn't wanna make a big deal out of it.

00:20:41.865 --> 00:20:45.576
But it is a big deal!
I have to tell someone!

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:48.287
No, no, no. You can't.

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:51.624
Please, please. We just don't wanna
deal with telling everyone.

00:20:51.792 --> 00:20:54.126
Please, just promise you won't tell.

00:20:57.714 --> 00:20:59.840
All right.

00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:03.344
Man, this is unbelievable!

00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:06.514
I mean, it's great! But...

00:21:07.391 --> 00:21:10.059
- I know. It's great! Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:12.937
Oh, I don't wanna see that!

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:18.109
We're so stupid.

00:21:18.318 --> 00:21:21.696
Do you know what's going on in there?
They're trying to take Joey.

00:21:28.078 --> 00:21:32.331
"The most popular Phoebe in tennis
is called the overhand Phoebe. Heh.

00:21:32.499 --> 00:21:35.876
If you win, you must slap your opponent
on the Phoebe and say, 'Hi, Phoebe!"'

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:40.881
Oh, that's cute.
We really all enjoyed it.

00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:43.134
- But you know it doesn't count.
- For what?

00:21:43.343 --> 00:21:47.346
Just count in our heads as good Mad Libs.

00:21:48.015 --> 00:21:50.349
- I guess fun time's over.
- Yeah, I'm done.

00:21:50.726 --> 00:21:52.977
Wait, guys, if we follow the rules...

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.521
...it's still fun and it means something.

00:21:55.689 --> 00:21:57.023
I'm gonna take off.

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.442
Guys, rules are good!

00:21:59.609 --> 00:22:01.402
Rules help control the fun.

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.322
Oh!
