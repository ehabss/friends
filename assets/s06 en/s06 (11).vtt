WEBVTT

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:04.795
Hey.

00:00:04.963 --> 00:00:06.046
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:07.423
Listen, uh...

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.758
You think I have a chance with Janine?

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:11.844
Ugh, we've been through this.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:13.429
Don't do this to yourself.

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:16.015
She made it clear it isn't
going to happen.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:19.727
All right, then. I guess I shouldn't
get too excited about the fact...

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:21.520
...that I just kissed her!

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:24.273
- Are you serious?
- That's great!

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.899
Yeah, well, we'll see.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:29.069
You kissed her?

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:32.031
Oh, we kissed it up real nice.

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.950
So you kissed. Then what happened?

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.953
I came over here to tell you guys.

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.873
So she's waiting over
there for you?

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.168
Yeah.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:32.091
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

00:01:34.636 --> 00:01:36.762
I'm gonna be late
for dance class.

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:38.680
Okay.

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:43.185
- Okay, now I'm really leaving.
- All right.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:44.520
But can you just...

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:46.897
...just leave your lips?

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:50.901
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:54.905
Have you kissed her yet?

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:58.325
It's awesome!

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.035
I could do it forever.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:04.998
You know what? She kisses better
than my mom cooks.

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.669
- I'm so glad you said "cooks."
- Right?

00:02:09.504 --> 00:02:13.465
Rachel, you've got to tell
the post office that you've moved.

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.843
We still get your bills and stuff.

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.555
Oh! Oh! Pottery Barn!
You can throw the rest away.

00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:21.765
I'm not your garbage man.

00:02:23.017 --> 00:02:25.060
I'm your mailman.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:27.604
Monica, look.

00:02:27.772 --> 00:02:30.649
Here is that table that I ordered. Ah!

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:35.112
- You got it from Pottery Barn?
- Yeah. It's an apothecary table.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.656
Does anyone even know what
an apothecary is?

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.575
A pharmacist.

00:02:40.618 --> 00:02:42.411
A pharmacist.

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:46.456
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn.

00:02:46.624 --> 00:02:48.083
I hate Pottery Barn too.

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:51.503
They kicked me out just
because I sat on a bed.

00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.381
You took off your pants
and got under the sheets.

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.385
I was tired.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.222
Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.433
She hates mass-produced stuff.

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.603
She thinks her furniture
should have a story behind it.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.813
This has a story behind it.

00:03:10.064 --> 00:03:14.401
They had to ship it all the way
from the White Plains store.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:19.406
It's got to be one-of-a-kind.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:23.619
Like that God-awful ceramic fruit
bowl she has on her counter?

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:26.622
Hey! I made that for her.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:29.791
- You made pottery?
- Yeah.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.878
I made it out of a fruit bowl
I found in the garbage.

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:38.508
If you put that in her apartment,
you'll never hear the end of it.

00:03:38.676 --> 00:03:41.261
I'll tell her that it's an antique.

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:43.430
She doesn't have to know
where it came from.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:46.183
Ah, I love these little drawers.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:49.436
Oh, look!
It says that it holds 300 CDs.

00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:52.898
Ah, just like the apothecary tables
of yore.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:00.989
So the farmer says:

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:02.991
"That's not a cow,
and you're not milking."

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.913
I'm so glad you're together.

00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:11.416
We wanted a couple to go out with
and now we have one.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.502
We're a couple of couples.

00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:17.547
I had so much fun tonight.
What a great restaurant!

00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:21.927
And Chandler, I can't believe
I let you pay for this one.

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:25.681
Thanks again, man.

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:30.060
If you come over tomorrow,
I'll make pasta.

00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:31.645
- That'd be great!
- Okay.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.314
But at least let us
bring the wine.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:37.818
- You don't have to.
- Ah, I insist.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.614
- You'll get the wine, right?
- Yeah.

00:04:44.742 --> 00:04:47.244
- Okay, good night.
- See you tomorrow.

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:49.121
Can't wait.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:56.670
How are we going to get
out of that one?

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:02.843
- What?
- I can't handle two nights in a row...

00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:04.636
...with them.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.180
What's wrong with them?

00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:08.974
They're just a little...

00:05:09.142 --> 00:05:10.600
...blah!

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:13.228
Blah?

00:05:13.938 --> 00:05:17.524
Well, you know, he's blah.
She's just...

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:20.485
She's very loud for such
a small person.

00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:26.116
Uh, they're my best friends.

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:30.037
Are you saying we can't go out?
'Cause that'd be a problem.

00:05:30.246 --> 00:05:32.331
Of course we can still
hang out with them.

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:35.208
Just not two nights in a row.

00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:40.255
- Okay?
- I guess.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.132
Thank you.

00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:48.638
I'll sell my friends and use
the money to buy you presents.

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.730
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:05:56.939 --> 00:06:01.693
Ooh! What a great table!
Where did you get it?

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:03.070
Guess.

00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:06.448
Um, a flea market?

00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:10.827
Ha, I knew you would get it
on the first guess.

00:06:10.995 --> 00:06:13.163
Isn't it cool?
It's an apothecary table.

00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:15.290
Ah, wow.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.585
You can just imagine
that this is where...

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:21.088
...they kept all their stuff
to make potions.

00:06:21.255 --> 00:06:22.297
- You know?
- Ooh, yes.

00:06:22.465 --> 00:06:25.842
Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.887
Almost.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.389
Oh, how much was it?

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:32.265
Just only 500 bucks.

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.101
500 bucks at a flea market?

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.938
I thought you meant how much was it...

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.023
...when it was new, back then.

00:06:40.233 --> 00:06:41.483
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, no.

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.694
It was at a flea market,
so it was like a dollar.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.408
- A dollar?
- And fifty?

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:52.244
So it was like
one and fifty dollars.

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:56.081
- They gave you the old-time pricing.
- Yeah.

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:59.167
Well, what period is it from?

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:00.961
Uh, it's from yore.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.380
Like, the "days of yore," you know?

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:05.757
Yes. Yes, I do.

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:09.219
- It's just perfect.
- Oh, good.

00:07:09.387 --> 00:07:11.596
I bet it has a great story too.

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:13.890
Did they tell you
where it's from or...

00:07:14.058 --> 00:07:16.935
Yes, that I know.
This is from, uh, White Plains.

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:20.522
- White Plains.
- Mm-hm.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.608
Ooh, it sounds like
such a magical place.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.240
- I'm here.
- Hi!

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:33.326
Oh, my God!

00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:35.287
- You like it?
- Oh, my God!

00:07:35.455 --> 00:07:38.165
It's my new apothecary table!

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:41.626
Phoebe'll be here any second.
She can't see this.

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:44.504
Why not? She'll love it.
It's the real thing.

00:07:44.672 --> 00:07:46.465
I got it at Pottery Barn.

00:07:47.467 --> 00:07:49.509
I know. I bought the same one.

00:07:49.677 --> 00:07:52.304
And if she sees your table,
she'll know I lied.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:55.390
- I said ours was an original.
- Why?

00:07:55.558 --> 00:07:57.559
Because she hates Pottery Barn.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:01.104
She hates Pottery Barn?

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.857
She says it's all mass-produced...

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:07.360
...nothing is authentic, and everyone
winds up having the same stuff.

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:13.742
So come on!
Can we cover this up, please?

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.035
What? No, no.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:17.454
I am not gonna hide it from Phoebe.

00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:20.332
Although I did get some great
Pottery Barn sheets.

00:08:21.709 --> 00:08:24.377
Ooh, I forgot they made sheets!

00:08:24.545 --> 00:08:26.630
Heh, yeah.

00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:31.343
I still can't believe
she hates Pottery Barn.

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.053
It's not like she hates you.

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.430
Yeah, but Pottery Barn?

00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.810
You know what I think?
She's just weird.

00:08:40.978 --> 00:08:44.356
It's because she's a twin.
Twins are weird.

00:08:45.358 --> 00:08:49.069
She's not weird. She likes
her stuff to be one-of-a-kind.

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:53.823
Huh. You know what's
not one-of-a-kind? A twin!

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.373
Let's turn out the lights
and watch the movie.

00:09:01.582 --> 00:09:05.252
- Hey, ooh, cool sheet!
- You like it?

00:09:05.419 --> 00:09:08.213
- You want to know where I got it?
- Sure.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:09.798
At a flea market.

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.094
You buy your sheets
at a flea market?

00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:17.889
Come on, you gotta loosen the
purse strings a little.

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:21.518
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:24.062
Dinner will be ready in 20 minutes.

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.898
Here is the wine to bring
over tonight.

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:30.360
You were also gonna
buy Monica flowers...

00:09:30.528 --> 00:09:33.488
...but you couldn't because
you paid for dinner last night.

00:09:34.865 --> 00:09:38.118
Thanks. But, uh, it's just
gonna be me tonight.

00:09:38.286 --> 00:09:42.080
- What happened to Janine?
- She's, uh, really sick.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.792
- That's too bad.
- Yeah, she's been in there all day.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:49.671
Uh, high fever, nose problem. It's...

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:51.923
...phlegm, phlegm,
phlegm, phlegm, phlegm.

00:09:54.844 --> 00:09:56.344
Monica! Chandler!

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:01.933
I'm sorry about tonight.
I don't know if Joey told you...

00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:05.270
...but I couldn't get out
of going to this play.

00:10:07.481 --> 00:10:10.233
Have a great time, huh?

00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:16.573
That's funny, I saw no phlegm.

00:10:21.412 --> 00:10:22.996
Oh, no, she really is sick.

00:10:23.164 --> 00:10:25.123
Then why is she going to a play?

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.626
Uh, well, you know, "Starve a fever...

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.711
...go to a play for a cold."

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:34.799
Why is Janine not coming
over for dinner?

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:38.637
Uh, she didn't want to hang out with
you guys two nights in a row.

00:10:38.804 --> 00:10:40.472
I'm so sorry.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:43.600
Why doesn't she want
to hang out with us?

00:10:45.227 --> 00:10:48.897
Because she, uh, thinks that
you are "blah."

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:53.777
And that, uh, you, Monica,
are too loud.

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:55.445
What?!

00:10:56.906 --> 00:10:59.115
What?

00:10:59.283 --> 00:11:01.451
So she just pretended to
have a good time?

00:11:01.619 --> 00:11:03.036
She was lying to our faces?

00:11:03.204 --> 00:11:05.080
I can't believe this.

00:11:05.247 --> 00:11:06.289
Who is she to judge us?

00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:10.835
- We couldn't have been nicer to her.
- And I am not "blah." I am a hoot!

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:12.045
I know, I know.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.589
Come on, please, you guys.
Don't be mad.

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:16.591
I'm sure she said it...

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:20.053
...because she was nervous 'cause
you're my best friends.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:22.389
And it was our first date.

00:11:22.556 --> 00:11:25.350
Plus, she's really sick.

00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:29.479
You said you made that up!

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:32.565
But isn't the "sick" thing
better than the "play" thing?

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:36.986
They're both good. I generally just
go with, "Monica's drunk again."

00:11:39.323 --> 00:11:42.534
Come on, please just
give her another chance.

00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:46.287
- She'll come around, I promise.
- Of course we will.

00:11:46.455 --> 00:11:49.082
- Come on, we gotta make dinner.
- Okay.

00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:55.130
I do not like that woman!

00:11:55.339 --> 00:11:57.549
I can hear you!

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:00.093
I am loud!

00:12:03.764 --> 00:12:05.181
Aw.

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.396
Isn't it good?

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.733
Can you please not put your
feet up on my new...

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.735
...old sheet.

00:12:17.278 --> 00:12:18.778
Oh, sure.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:21.948
My apothecary table!

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:24.743
- What?
- No!

00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:28.747
- Where did you get this?
- At Pottery Barn, okay?

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:33.251
Oh, my God!

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:37.797
Pottery Barn has ripped off
the design of our antique!

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:42.343
Wow. If they've ripped off our table...

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:45.513
...ours must be worth much more
than one and fifty dollars.

00:12:47.641 --> 00:12:50.018
This doesn't even
smell like opium.

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.188
It smells like wine,
which you spilled.

00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:55.356
And thanks for wrecking my sheet.

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:59.569
Ross, calm down.
I'll give you the 80 cents.

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:06.534
Okay, one more time.

00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:08.411
Would you like some orange juice?

00:13:08.579 --> 00:13:12.165
- Perfect decibel.
- I know!

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:15.460
Hey.

00:13:15.669 --> 00:13:17.712
Uh, what are you guys doing?

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:21.424
Nothing. We're just talking.
You know, blah-blah-blah.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.220
Come on, you said you were gonna try.

00:13:25.387 --> 00:13:29.057
I came over to invite you to
a movie with me and Janine.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:30.767
- What do you say?
- I'd like to...

00:13:30.935 --> 00:13:33.353
...but I'm not sure if we have the time.

00:13:34.688 --> 00:13:37.106
Ha, very funny. I don't know
what to do.

00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:39.234
I really want you to get along.

00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:42.195
Please, come to the movie with us.
You owe me.

00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:44.113
- We owe you?
- That's right.

00:13:44.281 --> 00:13:47.367
I helped you out in the
start of your relationship.

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.744
I helped you sneak around
for six months.

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:51.412
I looked like an idiot.

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:53.414
And I was humiliated.

00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:55.291
And I only made $200.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.879
We didn't give you any money.

00:14:03.092 --> 00:14:04.884
You don't think I know that?

00:14:09.306 --> 00:14:12.559
I can't decide if it goes
better by the new chair...

00:14:12.726 --> 00:14:13.768
...the Sahara desk...

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:16.187
...or the Parker console table.

00:14:16.355 --> 00:14:18.773
I didn't know there was
a Pottery Barn up here.

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.527
- I know, I went a little crazy.
- A little?

00:14:22.695 --> 00:14:25.572
Your place looks like page 72
of the catalog.

00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:28.283
Look at that!

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.579
- The ornamental birdcage! Large.
- Ha, ha.

00:14:35.374 --> 00:14:38.501
Oh, Ross? Be careful.
That is very old.

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:42.964
Colonial bird merchants used to
bring their birds to market in that.

00:14:44.216 --> 00:14:45.508
Fascinating.

00:14:47.845 --> 00:14:51.347
Another amazing find! Wow.

00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:54.976
- I bet this has a great story too.
- It does.

00:14:55.144 --> 00:15:00.148
It is a room-separating apparatus
from Colonial times.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:04.611
Huh, a lot of this stuff is from
the Colonial times.

00:15:04.778 --> 00:15:07.822
What are some other
time periods, Rachel?

00:15:10.242 --> 00:15:11.826
Well, there's yore.

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.874
Ahem, and, uh, you know, yesteryear.

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:22.795
Rachel has such a
good eye for this stuff.

00:15:22.963 --> 00:15:25.423
Ross, if you ever decide
to redecorate...

00:15:25.591 --> 00:15:28.051
- and I think you should...

00:15:28.218 --> 00:15:29.969
- you should ask Rachel to help.

00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:31.679
Aw, he doesn't need my help.

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:35.141
I think he's ready to get rid
of the... What'd you call it?

00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:37.644
The, uh, "cheap knockoffs
and dinosaur junk"?

00:15:42.566 --> 00:15:44.275
Really?

00:15:45.319 --> 00:15:49.530
You know, since you have such a
great sense of what I need...

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:51.574
Uh, here's 60 bucks.

00:15:51.742 --> 00:15:55.703
Why don't you take Phoebe down
to that Colonial, uh, flea market...

00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:57.413
...and get me some stuff?

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:04.587
I don't think Phoebe wants to come.

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:06.589
- I do want to.
- She does want to.

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:08.257
- She does want to.
- Yeah!

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.267
I guess the flea market
was just better last time.

00:16:18.435 --> 00:16:21.354
Well, at least I got these
sheets for Ross.

00:16:22.731 --> 00:16:25.400
Ugh, look at this. Pottery Barn.

00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:29.112
Ugh, yeah, you know what?
Don't look at it.

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:31.781
- Seriously, don't look at it.
- Look!

00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:34.158
There's the table
they stole from us.

00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:36.285
Oh, those bastards! Let's go.

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:42.458
That fan kind of looks like ours,
and the birdcage, and...

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:45.795
Wait a second, this is our
exact living room!

00:16:45.963 --> 00:16:48.131
No, it's not.

00:16:48.298 --> 00:16:50.633
Come on, ours is totally different.

00:16:50.801 --> 00:16:54.595
I mean, we don't have the...
We don't have that lamp.

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:59.767
And that screen is on
the other side.

00:17:00.686 --> 00:17:03.938
Oh, my God. This is where you
got all our stuff.

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:07.108
- Pottery Barn! Oh, my God!
- No. No.

00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:09.736
Okay, I did, all right?
I'm sorry.

00:17:09.903 --> 00:17:13.990
I wanted this stuff and I know
how you feel about Pottery Barn.

00:17:14.158 --> 00:17:17.076
- Come on, don't be mad.
- No, but I am mad.

00:17:17.244 --> 00:17:20.329
Because this stuff is what's
wrong with the world...

00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:22.874
...and it's in my living room...

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:27.003
...and all I can think about is
how I don't have that lamp!

00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:30.131
Well, then, honey, buy the lamp.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.633
We have that 60 bucks from Ross.

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:36.971
I can't! I can't!

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:39.098
Unless...

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:43.102
Are you saying you'd move out
if I didn't buy that lamp?

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:45.354
No, I'm not gonna move out!

00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:49.484
But are you saying that you would
move out if I didn't buy that lamp?

00:17:50.944 --> 00:17:54.280
- Yes! I would so move out.
- Then I don't have a choice.

00:17:54.448 --> 00:17:57.825
- I have to buy that lamp!
- That's right.

00:17:58.535 --> 00:18:00.828
But at least the apothecary
table's real.

00:18:06.376 --> 00:18:09.921
This was great.
Didn't everybody have a great time?

00:18:10.089 --> 00:18:12.757
I did. I really did.
And I've got to say...

00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:16.469
...I'm sorry if I was weird after
the last time we went out.

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:18.387
I guess I was just nervous.

00:18:18.555 --> 00:18:21.432
- That's understandable.
- Don't worry about it.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:22.850
So we can go out again?

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:24.644
- Absolutely.
- Well, good.

00:18:24.812 --> 00:18:27.063
- Okay, well, good night.
- Good night.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.277
See, huh?

00:18:33.445 --> 00:18:34.695
Wasn't that fun?

00:18:34.863 --> 00:18:36.781
We have got to move.

00:18:37.533 --> 00:18:38.991
What?

00:18:39.159 --> 00:18:40.493
I knew it!

00:18:42.246 --> 00:18:44.705
You're not so quiet yourself, missy!

00:18:46.625 --> 00:18:49.585
I'm blah? The only thing more
boring than modern dance...

00:18:49.753 --> 00:18:51.129
...is you talking about it.

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.755
"Oh, Chandler...

00:18:52.923 --> 00:18:54.966
...I just lost myself in the movement."

00:18:58.178 --> 00:19:00.346
You know, I know you're talking...

00:19:00.514 --> 00:19:03.349
...but all I hear is
blah-blah-blah-blah-blah.

00:19:03.517 --> 00:19:06.894
All right, you and me!
Let's go, right now!

00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:08.396
All right, enough!

00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:12.608
Enough! You two, go home.
I gotta talk to Janine.

00:19:12.776 --> 00:19:15.236
I really think you could take her.

00:19:15.737 --> 00:19:17.989
You better hope I don't
see you in the hallway!

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:25.121
All right. Uh...

00:19:25.289 --> 00:19:27.999
Look, we got a little bit
of a problem here.

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.626
You can't my treat
my friends that way.

00:19:30.794 --> 00:19:35.381
- They said stuff to me too.
- I know, I'll talk to them about it.

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.258
They mean so much to me.

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:39.719
They're like my family, you know?

00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:43.055
If you guys are gonna be
fighting all the time...

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:48.311
I don't think we can be together.
It just can't work, okay?

00:19:48.478 --> 00:19:49.645
It can't.

00:19:49.813 --> 00:19:51.606
I'm very upset.

00:19:53.233 --> 00:19:54.817
Okay.

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:57.278
Would it help if I apologized?

00:19:57.487 --> 00:19:59.155
Yeah.

00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:01.115
That'd be very helpful.

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:08.789
What did I tell you about the hall?

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.878
I was coming over to
apologize for my behavior.

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:18.090
I'd really like it if we
could be friends.

00:20:20.677 --> 00:20:24.931
Well, I know that would
make Joey happy, so...

00:20:25.098 --> 00:20:27.225
...I would like that too.

00:20:28.352 --> 00:20:30.895
- Great.
- Now, come on.

00:20:33.982 --> 00:20:36.359
- I'm glad we worked it out.
- Me too.

00:20:36.526 --> 00:20:38.486
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:41.822
- Or I'll hear you.
- That's it, big girl!

00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:45.493
Wait!

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:51.249
You'd better run!

00:20:52.167 --> 00:20:54.126
Did you hear that?

00:20:55.295 --> 00:20:57.964
- What am I gonna do?
- I'm sorry, man.

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:01.842
- Want to go watch?
- Yeah!

00:21:10.477 --> 00:21:11.519
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:14.397
- How you doing?
- So, uh, did she move out?

00:21:14.564 --> 00:21:16.399
Pretty much.

00:21:16.566 --> 00:21:18.943
I can't believe you just
broke up with her.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.195
When it's not right, you know it.

00:21:21.363 --> 00:21:24.615
- You okay?
- I'll be all right.

00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:28.953
- You know what'd cheer you up?
- What?

00:21:29.162 --> 00:21:33.082
I'm giving this lecture on
erosion theories tomorrow night.

00:21:35.419 --> 00:21:37.169
I think you should come.

00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:46.304
You're right, that did cheer me up.
