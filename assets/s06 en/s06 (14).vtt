WEBVTT

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:09.883
Oh. Uh, hey, Rach.
I was just coming over here to, uh...

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.971
Oh, wait, I don't have to lie to you,
you don't live here anymore.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.640
I'm eating their food.
What are you doing?

00:00:16.808 --> 00:00:19.226
Ross is on a date with my sister.

00:00:19.394 --> 00:00:21.645
They shut the drapes
two and a half hours ago.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.690
Whoa, I didn't know
we could date your sister.

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.237
Joey, we know you steal our food.

00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:33.115
I'm good.

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:35.159
Oh, are the drapes still closed?

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:38.996
Yeah. Who should've shut their drapes
is that perverted couple two doors over.

00:00:39.164 --> 00:00:41.707
- Is that a swing?
- Oh, don't even ask.

00:00:41.916 --> 00:00:43.375
Yuck.

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.047
I can't believe Ross is going out
with Rachel's sister.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:51.925
When Chandler made out with my sister,
I was mad at him for 10 years.

00:00:52.093 --> 00:00:55.095
- That was like five years ago.
- Yeah, you got five years left.

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.306
- Joey...
- You wanna make it six?

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.017
Oh, Ross, hey. Hi, how are you?
There you are.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:43.602
Hey.

00:01:44.395 --> 00:01:46.396
Can I get a cup of coffee?

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:50.359
So how was your big date last night?

00:01:51.486 --> 00:01:53.987
Uh, it was okay. Yeah, it was fun.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:55.197
- It was fun?
- Yeah.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:56.740
Great.

00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:01.745
So, uh... So did you guys hit it off?

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:06.834
- I guess so.
- So, uh... So did anything happen?

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.920
Because rumor has it
you guys shut the drapes. Heh.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:13.006
No, no, nothing happened.

00:02:13.174 --> 00:02:16.635
I shut the drapes to show her slides
of my favorite fossils.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.474
Oh, slides. Ha, ha.

00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:25.060
So really nothing happened.

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.565
Something could've happened, all right?
She really dug my slides.

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:33.819
- Mm.
- And she was definitely giving me the vibe.

00:02:34.028 --> 00:02:38.615
Was it the "Please don't show me
another picture of a trilobite" vibe?

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.076
Anyway...

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:44.329
If she wasn't into me,
why would she ask me out again?

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:47.040
- She asked you out again?
- Yeah, uh-huh.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:49.459
- Tomorrow night.
- Hmm.

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:53.422
Valentine's Day.
The most romantic day of the year.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.549
Who knows what could happen?

00:02:55.717 --> 00:02:59.178
I might not be shutting my drapes
to show her my slides, if you know what...

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.054
Okay, okay, okay, I got it, I got it.

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:03.724
I can't...
I can't go with the you-and-my-sister thing.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.351
I just can't. It's just too weird, all right?

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.687
I imagine the two of you together,
I freak out.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:12.774
- It just freaks me out, and I can't do it.
- Okay, okay, okay. No... Yes. It's okay.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.153
It's okay.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:20.365
Hey, it's too weird for you.
I won't see her again.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.118
- Thank you. I... Yeah.
- I mean, after tomorrow night.

00:03:23.286 --> 00:03:26.288
No, no, no. Please, Ross. I can't do it.
It's gonna freak me out.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.415
Okay, okay, okay.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:33.754
Okay. I'll tell her tonight
I can't see her anymore.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.964
Ross, thanks.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:41.929
- You want me to call her right now?
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

00:03:42.096 --> 00:03:44.806
I mean, come on, that's craz...
I mean, that's crazy.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.645
So, what's going on with you?
What is going on with you?

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.147
Well, um... Oh.

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:56.151
- I may teach another class this semester.
- Yeah, do it now. Call her right now.

00:04:01.824 --> 00:04:03.575
- This is my favorite part.
- Yeah, me too.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.581
Oh, you know what's sadder than this?
Bambi.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.126
I cried for three days with that movie.
No, wait, two.

00:04:13.294 --> 00:04:17.589
Because on the third day, my mother killed
herself, so I was partly crying for that.

00:04:19.384 --> 00:04:23.595
Well, see, now, that I can see crying over,
but Bambi is a cartoon.

00:04:23.763 --> 00:04:25.555
You didn't cry
when Bambi's mother died?

00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:29.893
Yes, it was very sad
when the guy stopped drawing the deer.

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:35.816
There's nothing wrong with crying.
You don't have to be so macho all the time.

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:37.818
I'm not macho.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:39.903
Yeah, you're right.

00:04:40.655 --> 00:04:42.698
I don't know what I was thinking.

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:46.785
I guess I just never really cried, you know?
I'm not a crying kind of guy.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.955
Come on, man, there's gotta be something
that gets you choked up.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.957
Like, uh...

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:54.501
What if you saw a three-legged puppy?

00:04:56.045 --> 00:05:00.090
I'd be sad, sure, but I wouldn't cry.

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:04.136
Okay, what if the puppy said,
"Help me, Chandler.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:08.724
All the other puppies pick on me."

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:12.978
Cry? I just found a talking puppy.
I'm rich.

00:05:14.355 --> 00:05:19.609
Oh. I've got it. I have got it.
Pictures from your childhood.

00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:22.279
This will get you going good.

00:05:23.531 --> 00:05:27.242
- All right, what's going on there?
- Oh, that's Parents' Day, first grade.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.330
That's me with the janitor, Martin.

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:34.333
- Where are your parents?
- Oh, they didn't wanna come.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.418
- Oh, Chandler.
- You poor thing.

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.670
So that story doesn't make you cry?

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:42.174
No. Look, I don't cry.
It's not a big deal, okay?

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:46.678
No. It's not okay. It's not okay at all.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:49.264
You're dead inside.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.562
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:57.981
- Are you Phoebe Buffay?
- Yeah.

00:05:58.816 --> 00:06:01.693
Can I get your autograph?
I'm your biggest fan.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:05.655
Oh, you're my biggest fan?
I've always wanted to meet you. Hi. Ha, ha.

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:07.741
- Sure, yeah.
- Wow.

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:09.201
Wow, thanks a lot.

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:12.496
I just wanna say
I think you're really talented.

00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:15.332
You're just saying that
because you're my biggest fan.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:19.795
Joey, listen, take good care of that guy.
He's a fan.

00:06:22.131 --> 00:06:23.882
Bye.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:29.304
So you saw me
on Days of Our Lives, huh?

00:06:29.472 --> 00:06:33.642
You want me to do a little
Dr. Drake Ramoray for you?

00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:39.481
I have no idea what you're talking about.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.275
But I just got Phoebe Buffay's autograph.

00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:47.572
- Oh. You're Phoebe's fan.
- Oh, yeah. I've seen all her movies.

00:06:49.283 --> 00:06:53.495
- Movies?
- That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.211
- I don't think so.
- No, no, it was.

00:07:01.379 --> 00:07:04.756
She was in Sex Toy Story 2...

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.008
...Lawrence of a Labia.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.637
And I got her autograph.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:13.640
The guys at the comic-book store
aren't gonna believe this.

00:07:17.228 --> 00:07:18.270
Gunther.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:22.524
Hey, don't let that guy in here anymore.
He just said Phoebe's a porn star.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:27.279
Well, I wouldn't call her a star,
but she's really good.

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:30.240
You should check out
Inspect Her Gadget.

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:36.746
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:38.748
You'll never believe what just happened.

00:07:38.916 --> 00:07:41.334
Ross totally blew me off
and didn't even tell me why.

00:07:41.544 --> 00:07:44.296
Oh, well. You know what, honey?

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:48.091
The best thing to do to get over a guy
is to start dating someone else.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:52.596
Oh. Oh, there is this great guy
you will just love at work named Bob.

00:07:52.763 --> 00:07:55.807
He's a real up-and-comer
in Human Resources.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:08:00.604
Thanks, but I'm not gonna date
some random guy from your work.

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:03.064
Not random. Bob.

00:08:03.941 --> 00:08:07.986
It's probably because
I'm not mature enough or smart enough.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.946
Maybe he doesn't like the way I dress.

00:08:10.156 --> 00:08:14.242
Pfft. No, that can't be it.
It's really gotta be the smart thing. Ugh.

00:08:15.036 --> 00:08:16.328
I'm so stupid.

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:19.748
I'm just this, like, incredibly pretty,
stupid girl.

00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:22.042
No, honey.

00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.461
Okay.

00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:28.173
Okay. You wanna know why Ross
canceled the date?

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.175
Because I asked him to.

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:32.677
- You asked him to?
Mm-hm.

00:08:32.845 --> 00:08:35.555
- Why?
- Because you are my sister...

00:08:35.723 --> 00:08:38.433
...and Ross and I have this huge history.

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.436
- You wanna go out with Ross?
- No.

00:08:41.604 --> 00:08:44.648
You don't want him,
but you don't want me to have him?

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:47.609
- You know, Bob in Human Resources...
- Ugh.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:51.029
I cannot believe you did this to me.
You had me doubting how smart I was.

00:08:52.406 --> 00:08:54.824
You had me doubting my fashion sense.

00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:57.327
This is not that big a deal.
Just don't date Ross.

00:08:57.495 --> 00:09:01.706
- There's a million other guys out there.
- You have no right to tell me what to do.

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:05.627
I'm not telling you what to do.
I am telling you what not to do.

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:10.840
- Why are you always so jealous of me?
- This is not about me being jealous of you.

00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:14.177
This is about you being a brat,
wanting what you can't have.

00:09:14.345 --> 00:09:15.720
Can't have?

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:18.974
Excuse me,
the only thing I can't have is dairy.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:24.437
All right, all right.
You just blew your chances at dating Bob.

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:26.565
- Who?
- In Human Resources!

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.277
I am jealous of her?

00:09:30.444 --> 00:09:33.863
I mean, who does she think she is,
Princess Caroline?

00:09:34.031 --> 00:09:38.159
- You're jealous of Princess Caroline?
- Do I have my own castle?

00:09:39.954 --> 00:09:42.706
Hey. Phoebe's not here, is she?

00:09:42.873 --> 00:09:45.417
- No.
- Oh, great, did you get a movie?

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.048
Uh...

00:09:52.216 --> 00:09:53.425
Yeah. Yeah.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:57.053
But, uh, I don't think it's the kind
you're gonna like.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:02.642
You didn't get more that are gonna have us
reaching for the tissues all night, did you?

00:10:08.232 --> 00:10:10.317
Sort of.

00:10:11.402 --> 00:10:12.611
Guys, what's going on?

00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:17.324
Phoebe's a porn star.

00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:18.867
- What?
- Yeah.

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:21.453
- What are you talking about?
- Where?

00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:26.207
"Phoebe Buffay in
Buffay the Vampire Layer."

00:10:27.251 --> 00:10:30.670
- Oh, my God. Ha, ha.
- That's Phoebe. Where did you get that?

00:10:30.838 --> 00:10:33.214
Down at the adult video place
on Bleecker.

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:38.136
And I saw Joey was about to go in,
so I ran in ahead of him...

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.388
...to surprise him.

00:10:40.556 --> 00:10:46.227
And then... Ha, ha. Then I pretended
that I didn't know he was in there.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:52.442
Wow. I mean, I just can't...
I can't believe this.

00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:54.986
You know?
I mean, you think you know someone.

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:57.530
Even Phoebe, who's always been
somewhat of a question mark.

00:10:57.698 --> 00:10:59.199
Hmm.

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:01.910
This is so bizarre.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:05.580
I guess it kind of makes sense, though.
She had such a terrible childhood.

00:11:05.748 --> 00:11:08.958
Hey, I had a terrible childhood
and I don't do porn.

00:11:09.543 --> 00:11:11.294
- Yes, but you're dead inside.
- Ah.

00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:15.340
- All right, well, I'd better take that back.
- What? Why? Why?

00:11:15.549 --> 00:11:17.676
We can't watch that.
I mean, that's Phoebe.

00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:23.181
- You're right. We shouldn't watch this.
- Absolutely not. That goes back.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:26.726
- But, you know, maybe a little bit.
- How about just the first half?

00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:29.896
Hey, no, this is wrong, you guys.
Phoebe's our friend.

00:11:30.064 --> 00:11:32.524
- I'm not gonna watch it.
- Yeah.

00:11:32.692 --> 00:11:34.359
- Good for you, Joe.
- Yeah.

00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:51.584
Ah. I thought I'd find you here,
Nosferatool.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:57.132
Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake
into my dark places?

00:11:57.299 --> 00:12:01.302
Actually, I was kind of hoping
it would be the other way around.

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:09.018
- Hold on, what is that on her ankle?
- Her ankle is what you're watching?

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.647
- Well, it's hard to tell.
- Ooh.

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:15.483
Oh, God, if she would just stop moving.

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:18.153
She's just doing her job.

00:12:18.362 --> 00:12:21.030
You sick bastards.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:26.119
Oh. It's a tattoo.
That's weird. Phoebe doesn't...

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:30.165
Wait, that's Ursula.
That's not Phoebe. That is Ursula.

00:12:30.708 --> 00:12:34.544
Wait, wait. I can watch that.
Rewind it. Rewind it.

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.088
- Hey.
- Oh.

00:12:37.256 --> 00:12:40.008
What's up? Oh, my God.
What am I doing?!

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:52.020
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey.

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:58.526
Chicken Soup for the Soul?

00:12:59.445 --> 00:13:01.696
There's no back to this couch.

00:13:03.532 --> 00:13:06.034
Why are you reading this?
You hate this kind of stuff.

00:13:06.202 --> 00:13:07.786
I figured I'd give it a shot.

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:09.996
Maybe one of those stories
would make me cry.

00:13:10.164 --> 00:13:12.582
Then you wouldn't think
I was all dead inside.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.502
Aw, that's so sweet.

00:13:15.669 --> 00:13:18.046
Chandler, I don't care if you can't cry.
I love you.

00:13:18.214 --> 00:13:22.300
Oh, that makes me feel so warm
in my hollow tin chest.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:25.929
- Stop it.
- I mean, come on, seriously. Think about it.

00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:29.516
We get married, I'm up at the altar,
and I'm like this:

00:13:31.352 --> 00:13:32.602
I won't care.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.980
Because I know that you'll be feeling it
all in here.

00:13:36.732 --> 00:13:38.149
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:13:38.317 --> 00:13:40.443
And if we have a baby one day...

00:13:40.611 --> 00:13:43.613
...and the doctor hands it to you
in the delivery room...

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:46.324
...and you don't cry, so what?

00:13:47.368 --> 00:13:50.286
And if we take him to college
and we come home...

00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:53.790
...and we see his empty room
for the first time...

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:56.292
...and you got nothing?

00:13:57.253 --> 00:13:59.712
Won't matter to me.

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:02.674
Okay.

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:06.010
Well, I won't worry
about this anymore, then.

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:08.471
Yeah. And, you know, if I die...

00:14:10.057 --> 00:14:12.433
...from a long illness...

00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:14.644
...and you're writing out my eulogy...

00:14:14.812 --> 00:14:18.481
...and you open the desk drawer
and find a note from me that says:

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:21.860
"I will always be with you"...

00:14:22.027 --> 00:14:26.739
...and you still can't shed one tiny tear...

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:29.659
...I know you'll be crying a river inside.

00:14:31.328 --> 00:14:34.455
- Aw, I love you, sweet...
- What is wrong with you?

00:14:35.332 --> 00:14:36.541
- What?
- What?

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:39.127
You can't shed a tear for your dead wife?

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.880
I mean, I left you a note from the beyond.

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:45.049
- So you didn't mean any of that?
- No, you robot!

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:55.476
You damn kids.
You ring my bell one more time, I swear to...

00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:58.688
Oh, uh, Jill. Um...

00:14:58.856 --> 00:15:01.733
That's just a little game I play
with the kids down the hall.

00:15:03.402 --> 00:15:05.653
They've really taken a liking to me.

00:15:07.698 --> 00:15:09.157
What's the matter?

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:12.577
Rachel and I had a really big fight.
Can I come in?

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:16.080
I know we're not supposed to see
each other anymore. I'm okay with that.

00:15:16.248 --> 00:15:19.792
I don't know anybody in the city,
and I need somebody to talk to about it.

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:22.754
- Oh, of course. What happened?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:28.551
Okay. Um...

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:32.639
- But you know what might cheer me up?
- What?

00:15:32.806 --> 00:15:35.683
Seeing some more
of your super-cool slides.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:38.937
- Wow, really?
- Totally. I loved them.

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:43.316
And maybe you could finish telling me
about all the different kinds of sand.

00:15:45.694 --> 00:15:50.114
I'd love to. You wait right here.
I'll go get the projector and my notes.

00:15:50.282 --> 00:15:52.617
Oh, great. Thanks, Ross.
You're such a good friend.

00:15:52.785 --> 00:15:54.202
Oh.

00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:01.918
Hey. Have you guys seen Jill?
I can't find her anywhere.

00:16:02.086 --> 00:16:03.503
- No, I haven't.
- Is Ross home?

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:06.631
Maybe I'll just call him
and see if he's actually seen her.

00:16:15.557 --> 00:16:16.599
Who is it?

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:20.353
It's Phoebe, "Phoebe."

00:16:21.855 --> 00:16:24.315
- Hey.
- Oh, God.

00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:30.446
- So you're making porn movies.
- No, I'm not.

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:32.865
We're still rolling.

00:16:33.033 --> 00:16:34.784
You're making one right now.

00:16:35.577 --> 00:16:38.913
- Let's go, Phoebe.
- And you're using my name.

00:16:39.123 --> 00:16:41.040
Yeah, can I help you with something?

00:16:42.292 --> 00:16:43.418
Phoebe, come on.

00:16:43.585 --> 00:16:47.755
Look, I'm talking right now.
You're... You mean her. Oh.

00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:51.342
You know,
twin stuff is always a real big seller.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.052
What?

00:16:53.262 --> 00:16:57.765
Yeah. I could talk them into giving you
like $30.

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.020
No. No way. No.

00:17:02.187 --> 00:17:05.440
And stop using my name.
And shame on you.

00:17:05.607 --> 00:17:08.276
And shame on all of you.
You're disgusting.

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:10.611
Especially you, with that.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.701
Slides are almost ready.

00:17:17.244 --> 00:17:20.788
Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing.

00:17:20.956 --> 00:17:22.623
Alcohol.

00:17:24.251 --> 00:17:27.545
- Okay, well, there's wine in the kitchen.
- Oh, great.

00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:32.633
Hello?

00:17:32.801 --> 00:17:37.180
What is my sister doing there,
and why are the drapes shut?

00:17:39.433 --> 00:17:41.434
Okay. Rach, calm down, okay?

00:17:41.602 --> 00:17:44.604
She's really upset. We're just talking.

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:48.232
I think she's trying to make something
happen with you to get back at me.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.235
Oh, so that's the only reason
she could be here, huh?

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:54.781
It couldn't have anything to do
with the fact that I'm a good listener...

00:17:54.948 --> 00:17:58.201
...and I put on a great slide show?

00:18:00.704 --> 00:18:06.000
Ross, I am telling you,
she is using you to get back at me.

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:11.005
You know, I think I can take care of myself.
I'll talk to you later. Goodbye.

00:18:12.091 --> 00:18:13.716
Whoa.

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:18.679
Uh, that was your sister, actually.

00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:21.182
She thinks you're just using me. Heh.

00:18:22.017 --> 00:18:23.726
So?

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:31.150
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:18:31.318 --> 00:18:34.529
So I just came from the company
Ursula works for.

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:37.323
Oh, no, not you too.

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.368
No, no.
I went to pick up Phoebe Buffay's checks.

00:18:40.536 --> 00:18:41.702
There were a lot of them.

00:18:42.704 --> 00:18:44.539
- Nice.
Mm-hm.

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:47.208
And I won't have to
go back there anymore...

00:18:47.376 --> 00:18:50.586
...because I gave them
my "correct address."

00:18:52.214 --> 00:18:56.300
That's great, but isn't it gonna bother you
that people think you're a porn star?

00:18:56.468 --> 00:18:58.719
Oh, no, no. I know how to handle it.

00:18:58.887 --> 00:19:00.513
- Good.
- Yeah.

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:04.559
You're trying to figure out
where you know me from?

00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:08.229
All right, I'll give you a hint.
From porn. Okay?

00:19:08.397 --> 00:19:13.025
Yeah, your pervert boyfriend
watched me in a porno movie!

00:19:16.613 --> 00:19:17.989
- See?
- Yeah.

00:19:21.785 --> 00:19:23.077
Hey.

00:19:23.328 --> 00:19:27.790
- You, uh, may have been right about Jill.
- Oh, I knew it. What happened?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.378
- Um, she kissed me.
- What? You kissed?

00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:35.131
- Maybe we should give them some privacy.
- Shh!

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:40.178
Look, I tried not to kiss her, okay?

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:43.598
It doesn't sound like it.
It's pretty easy not to kiss someone.

00:19:43.765 --> 00:19:47.185
You just don't kiss them.
See? Look at us right now, not kissing.

00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.562
Let me finish, okay?

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:53.941
She started kissing me,
and I didn't stop it.

00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:55.985
I guess I just wasn't thinking.

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:59.155
Yeah, that's right. I'm gonna give you
something to think about.

00:19:59.323 --> 00:20:00.781
Hold on.

00:20:00.949 --> 00:20:04.702
But then I started thinking
and I stopped the kissing.

00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:09.832
Oh, well, thank you for taking your tongue
out of my sister's mouth to tell me that.

00:20:13.086 --> 00:20:16.005
Look, I realized if anything were to happen
with me and Jill...

00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:19.508
...then nothing could ever happen
with us.

00:20:20.802 --> 00:20:22.720
- What?
- No, I mean...

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:29.101
Look, I don't know if anything
is ever going to happen with us again, ever.

00:20:29.895 --> 00:20:32.188
But I don't wanna know
that it never could.

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.650
So I stopped it...

00:20:36.526 --> 00:20:39.862
...and she got mad
and broke my projector.

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:47.703
Wow.

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:52.416
I don't even know what to say.

00:20:57.005 --> 00:20:58.839
Thank you.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:02.260
You're welcome.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.851
Oh, my God, are you crying?

00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:14.480
I just don't see why those two
can't work things out.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:22.989
All right, I'm leaving.
I'm not gonna spend one more day...

00:21:23.156 --> 00:21:25.658
...with someone
who's out to sabotage my every move.

00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:27.076
That's you, Rachel.

00:21:28.161 --> 00:21:29.328
Yeah, I got that.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:33.082
And you.
I throw myself at you, and you say no?

00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:34.458
How gay are you?

00:21:39.923 --> 00:21:42.008
You take care, Jill.

00:21:42.217 --> 00:21:45.052
- Okay, see you.
- Bye-bye.

00:21:46.471 --> 00:21:48.764
I can't believe Jill's gone.

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:53.436
I can't help it. I opened a gate.
