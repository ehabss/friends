WEBVTT

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.297
"We've got three minutes
till the reactor blows.

00:00:07.465 --> 00:00:08.549
We'll never make it!"

00:00:08.717 --> 00:00:11.802
"You've got to get out of here!
Save yourself!"

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:15.014
"No, I won't leave you."

00:00:15.181 --> 00:00:20.060
"Don't worry about me.
I'm a robot. I'm just a machine!"

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:25.274
- "No, you're not. Not to me."
- Oh, my God.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:28.610
- What?
- I am extremely talented.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:30.863
- Yeah. You're great.
- Yeah.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:35.159
- Okay, let's take it from...
- No, I was really acting my ass off.

00:00:36.327 --> 00:00:38.078
I thought I was pretty good too.

00:00:38.246 --> 00:00:40.789
Yeah, you're solid. You're just no me.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.668
You know what?
I think that's enough for now.

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.962
I don't want to be over-rehearsed.
Ha-ha-ha.

00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:50.215
Fine. I'll do it without you!

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.552
I don't need you or anybody else!

00:00:53.803 --> 00:00:56.346
I'm gonna make it on my own!

00:00:57.682 --> 00:01:00.517
You'll see! You'll all see!

00:01:42.143 --> 00:01:44.353
So, what's this thing
you're auditioning for?

00:01:44.521 --> 00:01:46.271
It's a new TV show. Yeah.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.817
I'm up for the part of Mac,
Machiavelli, or "Mac"!

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:56.031
I'm a detective and I solve crimes
with the help of my robot partner.

00:01:56.199 --> 00:01:58.784
He's a computerized, humanoid...

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:02.037
...electronically enhanced
secret enforcer.

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:04.081
Or, "C.H.E.E.S.E."

00:02:06.084 --> 00:02:10.420
- So, Mac and C.H.E.E.S. E?
- That's the title!

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.967
They really lucked out
that the initials spell "cheese."

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:17.344
That is lucky.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:21.265
Huh. So, Joey, if you get this,
you're gonna be, like...

00:02:21.432 --> 00:02:23.142
...the star of your own TV show.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:27.771
I mean, you'll be like the "Big Cheese"
or the "Big Mac." Hey, you love those!

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:31.483
Don't get your hopes up,
because it's probably not gonna happen.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:33.402
Now, why would you say that, Joseph?

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.655
Well, I mean, come on, you guys.
My own TV show?

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.575
- I don't know if I'm good enough.
- I am. Heh.

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:44.454
What are you talking about?
You're a terrific actor.

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:48.125
- You really think so?
- How can you even ask that question?

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:53.088
- She's pretty.
- Yeah. And she's really nice too.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.383
She taught me all about, you know,
how to work with cameras...

00:02:56.551 --> 00:02:58.552
...and "smell the fart" acting.

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:04.016
- I'm sorry, what'd you say?
- Excuse me?

00:03:04.184 --> 00:03:07.269
It's like you got so many lines
to learn so fast...

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:10.439
...that sometimes you need a minute
to remember your next one.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:15.736
So while you're thinking of it, you take
this big pause where you look all intense.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:17.404
You know, like this:

00:03:19.824 --> 00:03:21.158
- Oh.
- Okay.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.703
Here's my scene! Here's my scene!

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:29.041
Mrs. Wallace? I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray,
your sister's neurosurgeon.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.710
You sister is suffering from a...

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.179
Well, Eva,
we've done some excellent work here.

00:03:43.514 --> 00:03:50.145
And I would have to say,
your problem is quite clear.

00:03:51.272 --> 00:03:54.524
All you want is a dinkle

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.694
What you envy's a schwang

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:01.073
A thing through which you can tinkle

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.243
Or play with or simply let hang

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.828
I play Al Pacino's butt.

00:04:08.957 --> 00:04:13.335
All right? He goes into the shower
and then, I'm his butt.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.713
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, you guys.

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:20.217
This is a real movie and Al Pacino's in it,
and that's big!

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:24.304
No, it's terrific. You deserve this
after all your years of struggling...

00:04:24.472 --> 00:04:27.975
...you've finally been able
to crack your way into show business.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.023
Okay, fine, make jokes. I don't care.
This is a big break for me.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.401
- No, you're right, it is.
- Yeah.

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:40.570
So, you gonna invite us all
to the big opening?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.908
All right, I'm out of here.
Wish me luck.

00:04:45.076 --> 00:04:51.081
Good luck, good luck
We all wish you good luck

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:54.418
Yeah, whatever.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:00.924
It's your turn.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:03.885
Oh, are we playing this?

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:07.764
- Hey.
- Hey. How did the audition go?

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:12.144
Terrible. I messed up every line.
I shouldn't even be an actor.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:15.897
Wait. Are you doing that thing
where you pretend it didn't go well...

00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:17.482
...but it really did go well?

00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:23.280
- Yeah, did I fool you?
- Totally!

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.949
- So, it did go well?
- It went amazingly well!

00:05:26.117 --> 00:05:27.159
- Great.
- That's great.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:29.703
- It's down to me and two other guys.
- Oh, my God.

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.039
I know both of them,
and they're really good.

00:05:32.206 --> 00:05:35.334
One's from those allergy commercials
who's always being chased...

00:05:35.501 --> 00:05:38.378
...by those big flowers.
- Oh, I love that guy.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:41.465
Oh. What are you doing?

00:05:41.632 --> 00:05:43.300
What am I doing?

00:05:45.053 --> 00:05:48.805
I'm so nervous, you know?
The callback isn't till tomorrow at 5.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:50.724
I feel like my head's gonna explode.

00:05:50.892 --> 00:05:53.101
Well, it is overdue.

00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:56.104
Don't worry, okay?
You're gonna be fine.

00:05:56.272 --> 00:05:58.065
Yeah, but it's so much pressure.

00:05:58.232 --> 00:06:00.984
No offense, but what you guys all do
is very different.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.903
I don't know if you'd understand.

00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:06.365
Yeah, none of the rest of us
have to deal with pressure at our jobs.

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:08.492
Yes, I know what time it is...

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:11.370
...but I'm looking at the WENIS
and I'm not happy.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.915
Well, I'm tearing the lettuce.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:18.335
- Uh-huh? Is it dirty?
- No, don't worry, I'm gonna wash it.

00:06:18.503 --> 00:06:20.379
Don't. I like it dirty.

00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:25.092
That's your call.

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.178
So, uh, what are you
going to do next?

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:31.098
Well, I thought
that I would cut up the tomatoes.

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:33.266
Are they firm?

00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:36.770
They're all right.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:41.775
You sure they haven't gone bad?
You sure they're not very, very bad?

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.655
No, really. They're okay.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:49.574
You gonna slice them up real nice?

00:06:49.742 --> 00:06:51.701
Ahem. Actually,
I was gonna do them julienne.

00:06:54.205 --> 00:06:55.831
I'm out of here.

00:06:55.998 --> 00:06:59.543
Monica, I'm quitting. I just helped
an 81 -year-old woman put on a thong...

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.461
...and she didn't even buy it.

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:05.382
I'm quitting. That's it.
I'm talking to my boss right now.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.634
Yes, I am. Yes, I am.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:11.263
Okay, bye.
Call me when you get this message.

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.556
Well, what happened?

00:07:12.723 --> 00:07:17.227
Well, he came in for a massage,
and everything was fine until...

00:07:20.648 --> 00:07:22.190
Oh, my God.

00:07:22.358 --> 00:07:25.610
And all of a sudden,
his hands weren't the problem anymore.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.702
- Was it?
- Oh, Boy Scouts could've camped under there.

00:07:35.329 --> 00:07:36.955
You ate my sandwich.

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:39.666
It was a simple mistake.
It could happen to anyone.

00:07:39.834 --> 00:07:42.043
Oh, really?

00:07:42.253 --> 00:07:44.087
Now calm down.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.424
Come look in my office.
Some of it may still be in the trash.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.887
- What?
- Well, it was quite large.

00:07:52.054 --> 00:07:54.431
I had to throw most of it away.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:59.102
You threw my sandwich away?

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.147
My sandwich?

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:05.066
My sandwich!

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:09.279
It's just, I want this part so much,
you know?

00:08:09.447 --> 00:08:13.575
If I don't get this part, I'm never
gonna eat macaroni and cheese again.

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:16.328
No, I didn't say that.
That doesn't count.

00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:23.460
Come on, guys.
It's not like I moved to Europe.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:25.629
I just moved across the hall.

00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:28.006
And we would have you over
all the time...

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:32.344
...if it weren't for Monica's allergies.

00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:36.097
You're right, I could never lie to you.

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:37.641
She hates you.

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:42.312
Should I get that? Ha-ha-ha.

00:08:44.148 --> 00:08:47.484
Hello? Uh, no,
Joey's not here right now.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.194
Can I take a message?

00:08:49.362 --> 00:08:53.073
Yeah, okay. So the audition's
been moved from 5 to 2:30?

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.200
Okay, great. Bye.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:08.880
- Aren't you dressed yet?
- Am I naked again?

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:12.133
We're supposed to meet my parents
in 15 minutes.

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:15.011
Okay. I was just talking to the guys.
Just look at them.

00:09:15.179 --> 00:09:17.722
I mean, is it okay if they come visit?

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.100
What about my allergies?

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:23.019
Right. Your allergies.

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:27.023
All her. She hates you.

00:09:37.076 --> 00:09:39.077
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:41.621
Yes! All right.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.043
How cool would it be if you could watch
like a real life-size version of this?

00:09:47.211 --> 00:09:51.256
- I mean, how crazy would that be?
- As crazy as soccer?

00:09:55.595 --> 00:09:56.636
Hello?

00:09:58.014 --> 00:10:01.182
What are you talking about?
The audition's not till 5.

00:10:04.103 --> 00:10:05.979
Well, nobody told me.

00:10:06.647 --> 00:10:08.023
Who'd you talk to?

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:14.070
Never mind.

00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:17.449
You mean you didn't get it from this?

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:20.243
The allergy guy got the part. Thanks.

00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:22.120
Maybe we can fix it, you know?

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:26.082
Maybe we can send him
some big, big flowers and scare him!

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:28.293
How could you do this to me?

00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:31.046
This part could've turned
my whole career around.

00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:34.049
I messed up, okay?
I'm sorry. I really messed up.

00:10:34.216 --> 00:10:37.177
You don't even live here anymore.
Why'd you answer my phone?

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.846
- I have a machine!
- Which I bought for you.

00:10:41.098 --> 00:10:44.476
Taught you how to use it.
You thought it was a copier.

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:48.480
If there was anything I could do,
I would do it, okay?

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:51.775
But everybody's allowed
one mistake, right?

00:10:51.942 --> 00:10:55.111
He could have gotten me a VCR.
He could have gotten me golf clubs.

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:57.697
But no, he has to get me
the "woman repeller."

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.117
The eyesore
from the "Liberace House of Crap!"

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:04.079
- It's not that bad.
- Easy for you to say.

00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:07.290
You don't have to sport a reject
from the "Mr. T Collection."

00:11:07.458 --> 00:11:08.792
Chandler. Chandler.

00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:12.253
I pity the fool
who puts on my jewelry! I do! I do!

00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:14.005
I pity the fool that...

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:15.799
Hi...

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:20.095
When you were late last night,
Kathy and I got to talking...

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:23.348
...and one thing led to another and...

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:26.017
And what? Did you sleep with her?

00:11:26.185 --> 00:11:30.063
- No! No, I just kissed her.
- What? That's even worse!

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.817
- How is that worse?
- I don't know! But it's the same!

00:11:33.984 --> 00:11:37.362
You're right, I have no excuses.
I was totally over the line.

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:38.697
"Over the line?"

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:42.075
You're so far past the line
that you can't even see the line!

00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:43.827
Yeah, the line is a dot to you!

00:11:45.162 --> 00:11:47.664
I'm not saying that you should
magically forgive me.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:51.710
But you're not perfect. You've made
some errors in judgment too.

00:11:52.002 --> 00:11:53.086
Name one.

00:11:54.505 --> 00:11:56.047
What happened?

00:11:56.632 --> 00:11:59.968
Aw, man! He promised
he wouldn't take the chairs!

00:12:00.845 --> 00:12:03.221
What the hell happened?
How were you locked in?

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:05.306
And where the hell's all of our stuff?

00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:07.684
This guy came by to look at the unit...

00:12:07.852 --> 00:12:11.146
...and he said he didn't think
it was big enough to fit a grown man.

00:12:11.772 --> 00:12:14.441
So you got in voluntarily?

00:12:14.608 --> 00:12:16.568
I was trying to make a sale!

00:12:17.445 --> 00:12:20.822
Oh, man, if I ever run into that guy again,
you know what I'm gonna do?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.741
Bend over?

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.743
There's Lorraine.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:29.289
Okay, now remember, no trading.
You get the pretty one, I get the mess.

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:31.374
- Hi, Joey.
- Hey.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:37.714
Well, well. Look what you brought.

00:12:37.882 --> 00:12:39.549
And what did you bring?

00:12:41.552 --> 00:12:43.428
She's checking her coat.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.890
Joey, I'm gonna go wash
the cab smell off my hands.

00:12:47.057 --> 00:12:50.685
Will you get me a white Zinfandel
and a glass of red for Janice?

00:12:55.608 --> 00:13:00.820
Janice?

00:13:01.405 --> 00:13:06.326
Oh, my God!

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:09.746
Joey's tailor took advantage of me.

00:13:10.706 --> 00:13:11.748
What?

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:15.418
No way. I've been going
to the guy for 12 years.

00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:17.504
He said he was gonna do my inseam...

00:13:17.671 --> 00:13:21.466
...then he ran his hand up my leg
and then there was definite...

00:13:21.634 --> 00:13:22.801
What?

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.261
Cupping.

00:13:28.098 --> 00:13:30.600
That's how they do pants!

00:13:32.561 --> 00:13:33.728
Ross, will you tell him?

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:38.191
- Isn't that how a tailor measures pants?
- Yes, yes, it is. In prison!

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:42.111
I said name one!

00:13:49.787 --> 00:13:53.915
- I can't believe I did this. What an idiot.
- Stop beating yourself up.

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:56.751
People make mistakes.
These things happen.

00:13:58.379 --> 00:14:02.048
There aren't any messages
you've forgotten to give me, are there?

00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:04.926
Apparently, you're not very good at it.

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:08.263
- Do you think he'll ever forgive me?
- Of course he will.

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.516
Chandler, the most important thing
is that you forgive yourself.

00:14:11.809 --> 00:14:14.602
- You know what, I kind of have.
- Already?

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.688
That was pretty bad, what you did.

00:14:17.773 --> 00:14:19.649
You know what? He will forgive you.

00:14:19.817 --> 00:14:24.362
I like to bring a pad with me when I go
answer the phone, just in case. Okay.

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:26.489
You didn't see how mad he was,
you know?

00:14:26.657 --> 00:14:28.283
I'm sure he will forgive you.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:31.411
Look, we've all been there, you know?
You fight, you make up.

00:14:31.579 --> 00:14:32.829
That's the way it works.

00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:36.040
It took two people to break up
this relationship!

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.376
Yeah! You and that girl
from the copy place...

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.212
...which yesterday you took
full responsibility for!

00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:44.382
I didn't know what I was taking
responsibility for, okay?

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.342
I didn't finish the whole letter.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.219
- What?
- I fell asleep.

00:14:48.387 --> 00:14:50.096
You fell asleep?

00:14:51.098 --> 00:14:54.058
It was 5:30 in the morning.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:15:00.356
And you had rambled on for 18 pages.

00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:03.151
Front and back!

00:15:04.528 --> 00:15:09.407
And by the way? Y-O-U,
apostrophe R-E means, "you are."

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.826
Y-O-U-R means "your."

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:15.288
I can't believe I thought
of getting back together with you.

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.290
We are so over!

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:20.418
Fine by me!

00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:25.340
And just so you know,
it's not that common...

00:15:25.507 --> 00:15:28.843
...it doesn't happen to every guy,
and it is a big deal!

00:15:30.387 --> 00:15:31.888
I knew it!

00:15:33.098 --> 00:15:36.392
- You had no right to go out with him.
- That is the most ridiculous...

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.895
- You sold me out!
- I did not sell you out!

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:42.565
- Yes, you did! You absolutely sold me...
- Would you let me talk?

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:47.362
Did you just flick me?

00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:51.282
Okay, well, you wouldn't let me finish
and I was just... Ow!

00:15:51.450 --> 00:15:53.910
- Stop it! Ow!
- Ow!

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:55.411
- Stop.
- Stop.

00:15:55.579 --> 00:15:58.498
- All right. No, let's not do this.
- No!

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:02.001
- Happy thoughts.
- No!

00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:06.297
- Stop it!
- Oh! Oh!

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:09.384
Okay, now I'm gonna kick some ass!

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:12.845
- Ow!
- Ow!

00:16:13.013 --> 00:16:15.682
- Ow. Ow. Ow.
- I know, I know.

00:16:17.184 --> 00:16:22.063
All right. Now, I will let go
if you both stop.

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:23.898
- Fine.
- Fine.

00:16:24.692 --> 00:16:26.025
There we go.

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:31.781
Ha. You know what? If we were in prison,
you guys would be like my bitches.

00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:42.083
Okay, buddy boy, here it is.

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:46.546
You hide my clothes?
I'm wearing everything you own.

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:49.382
Oh, my God!

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:54.387
Look at me, I'm Chandler!
Could I be wearing any more clothes?

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:58.266
Maybe if I wasn't going "commando."

00:17:01.478 --> 00:17:07.275
Whew. I tell you, it's hot with all this
stuff on. I'd better not do any lunges.

00:17:59.661 --> 00:18:00.828
Joey?

00:18:01.955 --> 00:18:05.708
Got you the Joey special. Two pizzas!

00:18:06.668 --> 00:18:08.086
Joe?

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.798
Hello? Damn it!

00:18:14.051 --> 00:18:15.093
Hello?

00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:19.222
No, Joey's not here right now,
but I can take a message. I think.

00:18:20.474 --> 00:18:23.976
He's still got a chance for the part?
That's great news!

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:28.106
Well, no, obviously not for the actor
who was mauled by his dog.

00:18:29.024 --> 00:18:32.110
Well, that's great.
I will give Joey the message. Thank you.

00:18:32.277 --> 00:18:33.319
Yes!

00:18:34.696 --> 00:18:35.738
Okay.

00:18:36.198 --> 00:18:37.532
Mac...

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.909
...audition...

00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:42.703
...at 2.

00:18:43.956 --> 00:18:45.373
Allergy...

00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:47.166
...actor...

00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:49.919
...attacked.

00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:57.260
By dog...

00:18:57.678 --> 00:18:59.095
...not...

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:01.055
...flowers.

00:19:08.939 --> 00:19:12.150
- Hey.
- Please tell me you got the message.

00:19:12.484 --> 00:19:15.111
- What message?
- The actor playing Mac couldn't do it.

00:19:15.279 --> 00:19:19.115
- They needed to see you at 2:00.
- What? It's 6:00!

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:21.659
Look! I wrote it!
I wrote it on the board!

00:19:21.827 --> 00:19:24.745
I wrote it on the board,
then went looking all over for you!

00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:26.664
I went to Ross's, the coffee house.

00:19:26.832 --> 00:19:29.667
I went to any place
that they make sandwiches!

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:33.171
- I can't believe this, Chandler!
- I'm sorry.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.214
I don't know what to say!

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:38.885
You might say, "Congratulations."

00:19:39.052 --> 00:19:42.930
I saw the board, I went to the audition,
I got the part!

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.267
Was that supposed to be funny?
I was worried over here.

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:50.313
- I'm sorry.
- At times that fake-out thing is mean.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.940
Okay, man. I'm sorry.
I did not mean to make you feel bad.

00:19:53.108 --> 00:19:54.734
Well, that's good.

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:58.112
Because you didn't.
And I'm incredibly happy for you!

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:00.448
That's mean!

00:20:02.242 --> 00:20:04.911
- You had me going there!
- We could do this all day.

00:20:05.078 --> 00:20:06.621
Yeah, you're right.

00:20:07.331 --> 00:20:10.041
Look, let's talk about
what a huge star I'm gonna be.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:12.418
You are gonna be a huge star.
I'm gonna hug you.

00:20:12.586 --> 00:20:14.253
- You hug me.
- All right.

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:46.160
- Do we do this too much?
- I think so.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:48.329
- Yeah. Get off me.
- Yeah.

00:20:56.338 --> 00:20:58.881
"Come on, C.H.E.E.S.E.,
I'm not leaving without you.

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:02.218
Try routing your backup power source
through your primary CPU."

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:07.014
"I can't! My circuits are fried!
They're fried, I tell you!"

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.643
Wow.

00:21:11.228 --> 00:21:13.312
"Well, then I'll just have to carry you."

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.481
"That'll be a neat trick...

00:21:15.649 --> 00:21:19.318
...when you're dead!"

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:22.071
Ross, you don't have to yell.

00:21:22.239 --> 00:21:26.367
There was just an explosion, okay?
My hearing would be impaired.

00:21:27.494 --> 00:21:28.911
I thought you were excellent.

00:21:29.079 --> 00:21:32.081
In fact, for a minute there, I was like,
"Ooh, where did Ross go?"

00:21:33.333 --> 00:21:37.003
Thank you. And I have to say
that first scene where you meet Mac...

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.297
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God. I mean...

00:21:39.464 --> 00:21:40.589
You know what?

00:21:40.757 --> 00:21:43.843
I think that's enough for today.
Thanks for your help.

00:21:46.221 --> 00:21:48.556
- Holding us back.
- Totally.
