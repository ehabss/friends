WEBVTT

00:00:02.168 --> 00:00:03.585
- Okay, Chandler.
- Okay.

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:05.671
And your horoscope says:

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.258
"On the 5th, a special someone
is going to give you a gift."

00:00:09.426 --> 00:00:12.052
- Oh, well, thank you in advance. Mm.
- Ha, ha.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.763
"But the 12th brings a lover's spat."

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:17.558
You're going to make a joke
about my special present.

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:20.853
Why would you do that?

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:25.733
Oh, wait. "On the 19th,
a secret crush announces itself."

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:32.656
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.200
Oh, my God! It's Joey Tribbiani
of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:40.122
That's right. It's your first day.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.584
Are you psyched to fight fake crime
with your robot sidekick?

00:00:43.752 --> 00:00:46.253
Am I psyched?
The lead in my own TV series?

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.839
I've dreamed about this for years.

00:00:49.007 --> 00:00:51.425
Why have I not been preparing?

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.762
No, Joey, you're gonna be great.

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:58.599
But I gotta act with a robot.
I don't know anything about technology.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:01.727
I can't even use Chandler's computer,
except to find porn.

00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:06.231
And that's only because
it's there when you turn it on.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.986
Our lover's spat will start
a little early this month.

00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.446
I'll be waiting.

00:01:52.946 --> 00:01:58.075
Are you judging them by their covers?
Because you're really not supposed to.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.954
I'm deciding which one to use.
I'm going to start writing another book.

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:05.874
Because the last one
was such a big seller?

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:10.003
Well, if you must know,
I have written 14 books.

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:12.548
And as I'm the only one
who has read them...

00:02:12.715 --> 00:02:16.260
...I can tell you that
they have all been very well received.

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:19.054
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:02:19.222 --> 00:02:20.973
- Hi.
- What are you doing later?

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.475
Oh, Rachel and I have to get our hair cut.

00:02:24.102 --> 00:02:26.645
- We do?
- I want to see what he wants first.

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:30.774
I just found out Elizabeth's dad
wants to meet me.

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.568
Wait a minute. Hold the phone.

00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.070
You're not Elizabeth's dad?

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:40.742
Come on, guys.
I really want this guy to like me.

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.495
It would really help me out
if you guys could be here...

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:45.831
...to make me look good.
- Of course we'll help.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.541
- We'll be here.
- Thanks.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.544
We know how tough
those parent-teacher conferences can be.

00:02:55.884 --> 00:03:00.512
- So here's your office set.
- Wow, huh?

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.975
Mac Machiavelli, Private Investigator.
Eh?

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.686
- Let's get you to wardrobe for a fitting.
- Okay.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.646
Hey, uh, when do I meet the robot?

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:12.107
Why don't we do that right now?
He's right here.

00:03:12.275 --> 00:03:14.776
- Okay.
- Joey Tribbiani, this is...

00:03:14.944 --> 00:03:18.197
Wow! He's so lifelike.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.574
Unbelievable.

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:23.660
This is Wayne, the man who created
and operates C.H.E.E.S.E.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.038
How do you do there, buddy?

00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.291
- I'll let you two guys get acquainted, huh?
- Okay.

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.792
Sorry about that.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.881
- Uh, so where's C.H.E.E.S. E?
- C.H.E.E.S.E. Is right here.

00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:43.347
Nice to meet you, Mac.

00:03:46.351 --> 00:03:50.354
- This is the temporary robot, right?
- No. Why?

00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:53.815
Well, I just thought it was gonna be
a really cool robot.

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:57.152
Like the Terminator,
or, uh, when I first saw you.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:01.949
I spent two years developing this
machine. It's absolutely state of the art.

00:04:02.116 --> 00:04:05.452
I'm sorry. It doesn't look like
it can do anything.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.662
It can do this.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:17.839
Hey... Oh, ha, ha.

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:23.262
This is my father, Paul Stevens.
Dad, this is Ross Geller.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.847
It's great to meet you, Paul.

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:29.476
I prefer that Liz's boyfriends
to address me as Mr. Stevens.

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:33.021
Uh, of course. Mr. Stevens.

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.482
Good. So, Ross...

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.901
...what's your problem?

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:41.113
Excuse me?

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.282
Why can't you get a girlfriend
your own age?

00:04:43.992 --> 00:04:46.201
Heh. It's funny...

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:49.538
Um, it's not funny.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:52.374
I don't like you going out
with my daughter, Ross.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:55.294
Okay, um, I can see that.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:05:00.799
But I think if you give me, um, one chance,
I can change your mind.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.427
- Okay.
- What?

00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:06.763
Okay. I'll give you one chance
to change my mind.

00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:09.057
You've got one minute.

00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.977
- Daddy.
- Fine.

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:14.479
Two minutes. Go.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.694
A minute and 50 seconds.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.071
Okay, um...

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:26.408
I want you to know, I have never
done anything like this before.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:29.703
I mean, I've been in, um,
relationships in general.

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:33.040
But I've never done it with a student.
I mean, not...

00:05:34.917 --> 00:05:37.627
Not "it." We haven't done "it."

00:05:37.795 --> 00:05:41.798
Uh... We, I mean...
I mean, we've done stuff...

00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:47.637
Okay. Okay. A joke.
A joke. Lighten the mood.

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:50.682
Um, two guys go into a bar.
One of them is Irish.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.644
- I'm Irish.
- And the Irish guy wins the joke.

00:05:56.481 --> 00:05:57.647
- Ross?
- Ross!

00:05:57.815 --> 00:06:01.985
- How crazy that we would run into you.
- Oh, my God! Thank you.

00:06:02.612 --> 00:06:03.904
Um, uh...

00:06:04.072 --> 00:06:06.198
Mr. Stevens,
I'd like you to meet my friends.

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:08.283
This is Phoebe, Monica, and Chandler.

00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:12.746
So you're Elizabeth's father, huh?
I can see now where she gets her...

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:15.082
...rugged handsomeness.

00:06:17.085 --> 00:06:19.711
Is there a Mrs. Stevens?

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:22.881
There's a Mr. Bing!

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:28.720
No, unfortunately, Lizzie's mom
passed away shortly after she was born.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:31.848
- I raised her by myself.
- Oh...

00:06:32.016 --> 00:06:34.142
I get that a lot.

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.021
Okay, um, why don't we all
take a seat, you know? Heh.

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:41.733
And, uh, I'll get us all
some, uh, coffees.

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:44.569
Yeah, why don't you... Ahem. Uh...

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:47.239
And you guys can talk about
whatever you want.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:50.409
Whatever pops into your head.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:54.830
It is so strange seeing Ross here,
this time of day...

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.457
...because usually
he's at the children's hospital.

00:06:57.625 --> 00:07:01.086
Yeah. But not looking for dates.

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:07.676
So, um, Monica is Ross' sister.

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:09.469
He's a great brother!

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:11.513
- I had a sister.
- Oh.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.390
- She passed away.
- Oh...

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:15.642
You don't have to do that every time.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:20.522
But, uh, Ross is a great guy.
I was roommates with him in college.

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.108
Funny story, heh, ha, ha...

00:07:23.276 --> 00:07:26.319
Your roommate in college died,
didn't he?

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.656
A part of him did, yes.

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.285
Okay! Here we are, Paul, Elizabeth.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:36.079
I hope you guys were finding
something to talk about.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.123
- Yes. We were just...
- Sorry I'm late.

00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:42.169
But I am ready, ready to talk you up. Heh.

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:44.921
- When does Liz's father get here?
- I'm already here.

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:48.675
Oh, Ross is so great.

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:57.142
Honey, you got the kind with the little girl.
You said we'd get the kind with the baby.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.645
- You said the baby creeps you out.
- The little girl creeps me out.

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:03.231
- You said the baby.
- Why would the baby creep me out?

00:08:03.399 --> 00:08:06.151
Why would the little girl
creep you out?

00:08:06.319 --> 00:08:08.695
I'm sorry.
Can you please talk a little slower.

00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:11.198
- This is for your book?
- It's about relationships.

00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:13.992
You know, the traps, the pitfalls,
what not to do.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.995
- Keep going. This stuff's great.
- What?

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.705
Excuse me.

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:22.667
And how none of it matters
when the people really love each other.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:28.965
And how people will believe anything you
tell them as long as it's a compliment.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.891
- Oh, hi! Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:41.436
- I left my keys here somewhere.
- Oh, well, let's look for them.

00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:43.897
Under here... Oh, hey!

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:46.066
Hey! Are these them?

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.527
No.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.322
- All right.
- Oh.

00:08:53.407 --> 00:08:55.033
- Here they are.
- Good.

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.868
- Thanks for your help.
- Wait! Sorry!

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:58.870
- Mr. Paul?
- Just call me Paul.

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:02.082
Paul. Um,
I just wanted you to know that...

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.668
...you know, Ross really is a great guy.

00:09:04.835 --> 00:09:08.421
Maybe you could date him then. It
would save me the trouble of killing him.

00:09:13.553 --> 00:09:14.636
Are you okay?

00:09:14.804 --> 00:09:17.639
You just don't look old enough
to have a 20-year-old daughter.

00:09:17.807 --> 00:09:19.599
Well, we were very young
when we had her.

00:09:19.767 --> 00:09:24.396
- Ah. We?
- Yeah, it usually takes two people to...

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.940
Oh, no! Yes! Of course. I know that.

00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:31.695
What I meant was are you still "we"
or are you just you?

00:09:32.196 --> 00:09:33.989
I'm just me. Yeah.

00:09:34.156 --> 00:09:36.825
My wife died shortly
after Lizzie was born.

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:38.159
Oh.

00:09:38.327 --> 00:09:42.122
- So you raised her all on your own?
- Yes, I did.

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.583
Oh...

00:09:47.628 --> 00:09:49.087
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:51.006
- How was your first day?
- Great.

00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:53.633
Except I got a little attitude
from the robot.

00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:57.137
Damn those robots. They're supposed
to be our faithful servants!

00:09:58.222 --> 00:10:00.724
It wasn't the robot,
it was the guy who controls him.

00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:04.227
He doesn't like me. He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
Knock over the sandwich table...

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:06.771
...right when I was reaching for one. Ugh.

00:10:06.939 --> 00:10:08.607
Why don't you get him fired?

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:12.444
I may have to. I hate to do it.
But I'm the star, you know?

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.905
There's a limit to how many sandwiches
I can eat off the floor.

00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:20.118
Excuse me.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:22.579
Joey Tribbiani.

00:10:22.747 --> 00:10:26.458
Joe! I'm glad I found you!
I got an audition for you.

00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:29.628
- Wow.
- The thing is, it's kind of on the q.t.

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:33.715
The actor who has the part
doesn't know he might be fired.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:35.842
It's the lead in a series.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:37.761
Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

00:10:39.597 --> 00:10:41.348
I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:43.767
Uh-oh.

00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:48.229
Joey?

00:10:50.191 --> 00:10:51.274
Hi, Ross.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.781
I was just getting him to like you.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:06.247
Joey?

00:11:07.208 --> 00:11:09.626
- Joey!
- Hey, Ross.

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:11.628
Ross, Joey is not here.

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:14.047
Okay, I'll just wait for him in here!

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:16.800
Ross, it's okay. You can come out.

00:11:16.967 --> 00:11:19.427
Yeah, Ross. It's okay. It's me...

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:21.429
...Mr. Stevens.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.726
Oh, I didn't... Oh, my gosh.
I didn't even see you.

00:11:26.894 --> 00:11:29.938
Sure you did. You came in,
got all awkward and ran to the bedroom.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.065
You were shouting, "Joey, Joey!"

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:36.111
- Bye, Rachel.
- Bye.

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:37.946
- I'll call you later.
- Okay. See you!

00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:40.740
- Bye, Ross.
- Ah, hoo. Ha, ha.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:45.787
What? What the...? How did...? What?

00:11:46.997 --> 00:11:51.126
You know, he lost his keys.
So he was looking for them.

00:11:51.293 --> 00:11:52.711
In your mouth?

00:11:55.047 --> 00:11:56.506
No.

00:11:56.674 --> 00:11:58.758
Downstairs. And we got to talking...

00:11:58.926 --> 00:12:03.221
...for two hours. I really liked him.
I invited him for a cup of coffee.

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:06.307
You were at the coffee house!

00:12:07.727 --> 00:12:10.395
Ross, what's the big deal?
So I kissed the guy.

00:12:10.563 --> 00:12:14.816
He's my girlfriend's father. Okay?
It's weird!

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:18.111
- You dated my sister.
- That was different!

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:22.407
- What? Why?
- This is weird for me!

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:26.286
Ross, look. This is good for you, okay?

00:12:26.454 --> 00:12:29.539
Let's face it.
So far the guy's not loving you.

00:12:29.707 --> 00:12:32.959
But I can turn that around.
I've got the inside track.

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:37.005
We could all go out to dinner.
And I could talk you up.

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:41.509
Plus the guy is a very,
very successful lawyer.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:44.888
- How is that important?
- Oh, it's important.

00:12:47.808 --> 00:12:50.643
There's a million guys
out there who can play Mac...

00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:52.187
...and there's only one robot.

00:12:52.354 --> 00:12:55.857
And this one guy who controls it.
I didn't know he could get me fired.

00:12:56.025 --> 00:12:58.026
- What am I gonna do?
- Well, Joey.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:00.487
You're a pretty charming guy.

00:13:00.654 --> 00:13:02.864
Thanks. But I have a
problem to deal with.

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:06.284
No, sweetie. You've got to win over
the guy who controls C.H.E.E.S.E.

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:10.371
Go back there
and kiss some serious robot ass!

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.374
That's not a bad idea!

00:13:13.542 --> 00:13:18.087
If I have to turn on the charm tomorrow,
I'm not wasting any of it on you guys.

00:13:18.255 --> 00:13:21.591
Oh, actually I got a little bit
saved for you, Pheebs.

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:27.639
So do you think, uh,
Joey is more charming than me?

00:13:27.807 --> 00:13:30.391
Yeah. That's why I'm sleeping
with him on the side.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:32.685
Yeah, you wish.

00:13:36.023 --> 00:13:39.359
- "You wish."
- Phoebe, stop writing about us.

00:13:39.527 --> 00:13:42.987
I'm not writing about you.
I'm writing about other people.

00:13:44.198 --> 00:13:46.908
- Who?
- Marsha and Chester.

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:52.121
Okay, fine. Fine. Then you know what?
I will just write about Phyllis.

00:13:52.289 --> 00:13:53.331
- Hmm.
- Huh.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:57.001
- "Phyllis is sitting in the chair."
- I see what you're doing.

00:13:57.169 --> 00:13:59.963
- "Phyllis sees what I'm doing."
- Oh, ho.

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:05.426
Ooh, I have tasted my own medicine
and it is bitter.

00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:12.934
Morning! Hey!

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:15.436
How's my favorite genius
and his robot buddy?

00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:19.315
- Don't touch him!
- Okay. All right. Um...

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:24.279
Wayne, level with me. I keep hearing
all these rumors that I might get fired.

00:14:24.446 --> 00:14:27.657
They even have actors coming in
to read for my part.

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.326
Come on, man.
You gotta give me a second chance.

00:14:30.494 --> 00:14:33.079
I love this little guy... Aah.

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:37.792
Okay. That's why you didn't want me
to touch him, right? There you go.

00:14:39.795 --> 00:14:42.839
Stupid! I can't believe this! God.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:47.010
Hey, how are you doing?

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:55.393
So it seemed that my prom date
had stood me up.

00:14:55.561 --> 00:15:00.148
So Ross selflessly offered to take me.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.525
- What a nice story.
- Heh.

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:04.235
So Ross was in college...

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:07.864
...and decided to jump at the chance
to take a young girl to her prom.

00:15:10.159 --> 00:15:14.787
Wow. I definitely did
not see that one backfiring.

00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:18.458
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Yeah. Take your time.

00:15:20.794 --> 00:15:25.006
Just so you know, I was a freshman and
she was a senior. So it wasn't as bad as...

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:29.260
Ross, look. I know I've been giving you
a lot of jabs.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:33.056
It's partly because
I'm very protective of Lizzie...

00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:36.976
...and partly because
they just keep coming to me.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.107
I have to admit that after all
the wonderful things Lizzie has told me...

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:48.988
...and the many, many, many
stories that Rachel has told me...

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:51.282
...that, well...

00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:54.118
...you're not...

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:56.704
...all bad.

00:15:58.499 --> 00:16:00.458
"Not all bad."

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:04.504
I'm sorry I was so harsh.
But you have to understand.

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:08.216
I still look at Lizzie
like she's a 12-year-old girl.

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:12.345
You know, I know what you mean.
I do that, too.

00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:18.893
- I beg your pardon?
- No! I don't see her as a 12-year-old girl.

00:16:19.061 --> 00:16:23.147
I mean, I have a son who's, um, 6,
and I still think of him as a baby.

00:16:23.315 --> 00:16:25.817
- You have a son?
- Yeah. My ex-wife and I...

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:28.778
...uh, share custody of Ben. And, uh...

00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.614
Just so you know,
Carol and I are on excellent terms...

00:16:31.782 --> 00:16:33.574
...as I'm sure you are with your wife.

00:16:33.742 --> 00:16:35.702
Oh! I'm sorry.

00:16:36.787 --> 00:16:38.913
It's unbelievable!

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:42.000
Don't worry.
I just didn't realize you were married.

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.794
Oh, we were. But that was just a...

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:51.759
I mean, that was just
a big drunken mistake.

00:16:54.555 --> 00:16:56.055
You're back.

00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:00.351
You two were married?

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:03.479
Oh, whoops. I'm sorry.
You were talking about Emily.

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:09.444
We said we would meet
at the coffee house at 6:00.

00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:12.530
- We said 7:00.
- We said 6:00!

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.699
The only way that I said 6:00...

00:17:14.867 --> 00:17:19.954
...would be if I said the sentence,
"Let's meet at 7:00, not at 6:00."

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:23.166
If I had said 7:00, I would have
said something like:

00:17:23.333 --> 00:17:27.420
- "Wow, my boyfriend
is such a wiseass. -00!"

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:30.715
- Hi!
- Oh, my good God!

00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:33.176
- I know what time you said.
- What?

00:17:33.343 --> 00:17:36.721
Well, actually I know what time
Chester and Marsha said.

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.767
- What time?
- Quite an interesting turn of events.

00:17:40.934 --> 00:17:44.771
Suddenly it's my book
to the rescue, huh? Let's see.

00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:47.648
Ooh. Very interesting.

00:17:47.816 --> 00:17:50.443
Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.

00:17:51.361 --> 00:17:53.112
- What does it say?
- I will tell you...

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.448
...as soon as you thank me
for writing my book.

00:17:57.284 --> 00:18:00.620
Thank you for writing your book.
It's a great book...

00:18:00.788 --> 00:18:04.749
...and you are the queen of everything.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.877
Thanks. So are you.

00:18:13.092 --> 00:18:16.135
I told you I should not wear this color.

00:18:19.014 --> 00:18:25.019
"Monica... Marsha and Chester are
planning on seeing a movie Sunday night.

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:27.355
"Marsha thinks they're supposed to
meet at 6:00.

00:18:27.523 --> 00:18:29.440
Chester thinks it's at 7:00."

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:33.611
- You knew we would miss the movie?
- That's right.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:37.448
Instead of telling us, you decided
to write it in your stupid book?

00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:40.868
"Marsha and Chester are mad at Phyllis."

00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:49.001
I can't believe I'm gonna lose this job.

00:18:49.169 --> 00:18:51.796
I'm so sorry, man.
Is there anything I can do?

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:55.383
Yeah. Help me get this mini-fridge
past the security guard.

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:03.724
Hey, Joey, I want to talk to you.

00:19:03.892 --> 00:19:08.312
Yeah? I don't want to talk to you, Wayne.
I hate you. You ruined my life.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.107
- Oh, Chandler, Wayne. Wayne, Chandler.
- Hi. How are you?

00:19:11.775 --> 00:19:15.403
Joey, I'll get you your job back
if you help me out.

00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:17.613
Why should I help you out?

00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:21.701
- The reason he just said.
- What do you need?

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:26.330
I saw you on stage talking
to that beautiful woman.

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:30.126
You know, Sarah.
I wish I could talk to her.

00:19:30.294 --> 00:19:32.670
- Are you in love with her?
- Yeah.

00:19:32.838 --> 00:19:35.590
Her. All of them. Anyone.

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:38.050
Yeah. I've been there, my friend.

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:41.262
Listen, I guarantee you keep your job...

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.265
...if you can teach me how to talk
to women like you do.

00:19:44.433 --> 00:19:49.687
Oh, Wayne, it's not something you can
teach. It's something you're born with...

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.607
You can teach it.
I can show you right now.

00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:55.735
I mean, if you think about it...

00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:59.113
...Ross did learn something
from each marriage.

00:19:59.281 --> 00:20:02.200
- How to make the next one even shorter?
- Oh.

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:03.993
Wait a minute. That's not fair.

00:20:04.161 --> 00:20:07.330
He was married to me a hell of a lot
longer than he was to Emily.

00:20:07.497 --> 00:20:09.665
He just didn't tell me.

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:15.254
Maybe I have to pee again.

00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:22.261
Well, this is fun.

00:20:22.971 --> 00:20:24.764
So Ross...

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.807
...did you kill any of these wives?

00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:28.392
You know what? I...

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.105
I have had enough of this.
I care a great deal about your daughter.

00:20:33.273 --> 00:20:35.733
And I have treated her
with nothing but respect.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:39.403
- So if you've got a problem with me...
- Are you yelling at me?

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:41.530
God, no.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:46.494
You know what, Daddy?
If you don't like Ross, that's fine.

00:20:46.662 --> 00:20:49.956
It doesn't matter to me.
I'm gonna go out with him anyway.

00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:52.041
Really?

00:20:52.209 --> 00:20:54.418
Well, if it doesn't matter to her...

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:57.630
...it doesn't matter to me.
Still not yelling.

00:21:00.050 --> 00:21:03.302
Well, what can I say?

00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:08.266
This doesn't make me like you better.

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:11.769
That's okay. I'm not so crazy
about myself right now either.

00:21:11.937 --> 00:21:14.522
- Then we agree?
- Yeah, I guess so.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.482
- Neither of us like Ross.
- I like Ross.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:19.360
Oh, heh, kids!

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:24.949
Wait. I just thought of another story
about how nice Ross is.

00:21:25.117 --> 00:21:27.743
That's okay, Rach.
We're not liking Ross right now.

00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:30.538
- Oh! Well, I got a lot of those, too.
- Uh...

00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:37.336
Well, it turns out you were right,
C.H.E.E.S.E.

00:21:37.504 --> 00:21:40.923
- That shipment never made it to Omaha?
- You got it.

00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:44.885
And the rabbi's beard?
100 percent horse hair.

00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:46.679
Nice catch, C.H.E.E.S.E.

00:21:51.977 --> 00:21:53.978
It's your line, C.H.E.E.S.E.

00:21:56.732 --> 00:21:58.733
Wayne! Wayne!
