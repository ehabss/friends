WEBVTT

00:00:04.462 --> 00:00:06.964
- Hey.
- Hey, check it out. This is unbelievable.

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:10.342
Joey has been holding his breath
for almost four minutes.

00:00:16.057 --> 00:00:17.766
Are you trying to kill me?

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:21.395
- Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.
- Uh-huh, what?

00:00:21.563 --> 00:00:26.233
Um, well, since I'm moving out
and you're so beautiful...

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:27.735
...how about I move in with you?

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:31.155
Well, that would be great,
but then what do we do about Denise?

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:34.408
- Who's Denise?
- My roommate.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.786
- You have a roommate?
- Yes, Denise. Denise.

00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:41.707
Hey, what is with the secrecy, Phoebe?
Huh?

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.126
And what about this Denise? She cute?

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:48.130
How can you have a roommate
that none of us know about?

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.591
Maybe because you never listen
to anything I say.

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:52.926
I talk about her all the time. Denise!

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:58.474
Rach, I was thinking, I'm gonna have
an extra room over at my place.

00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.893
- Oh, that's true.
- Why don't you move in with me?

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.979
It'll be great.
We can stay up late talking, watch movies.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.565
And you know
about naked Thursdays, right?

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.862
Yeah, yeah,
I think I'm gonna find my own place.

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.741
Hey, hey. I thought naked Thursdays
was just our thing, man.

00:01:57.867 --> 00:01:59.701
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.038
What did Rachel say when you told her
you were still married to her?

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:06.291
Oh, that. Um, she took it really well.

00:02:06.501 --> 00:02:09.586
- Oh. You didn't tell her, did you?
- No.

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:13.507
- Because you're in love with her.
- I am not in love with her.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:15.843
She was very upset
about having to move out.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.638
So I didn't tell her we were still married,
because she'd only get more upset.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.015
I comforted her. As a friend.

00:02:22.183 --> 00:02:25.435
- What do you mean, "comforted her"?
- It was nothing. I gave her a hug.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:28.397
Aha. A classic sign of love, the hug.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.191
It's also a sign of friendship.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:33.277
Yeah, not in your case, Lovey Loverson.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.113
It was a hug.

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:39.116
Just tell me this,
did you or did you not smell her hair?

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:43.620
Smell her hair? Well, what if I did?

00:02:43.788 --> 00:02:47.541
Ninety percent of a woman's pheromones
come out the top of her head.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.210
That's why women are shorter.

00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:54.047
So that men will fall in love
when they hug them.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:57.426
Come on, Ross, you're a scientist.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.220
I was hugging her as a friend, okay?

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:02.639
It's not my fault her hair got in my face.

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:06.226
She's got a lot of it,
and it smells all, uh...

00:03:06.811 --> 00:03:08.645
...you know, coconutty.

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:13.901
What? Oh. It doesn't mean
I have feelings for Rachel.

00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:16.612
Maybe it means I have feelings
for coconuts.

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:21.783
Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful.
Rachel's not in the same place you are.

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:24.786
Okay, if the place you're referring to
is being in love...

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:30.500
...then she is in the same place as me,
because I am not in that place.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:32.836
Okay, I didn't understand that.

00:03:34.505 --> 00:03:38.008
But maybe that's because you were
speaking the secret language of love.

00:03:42.597 --> 00:03:43.639
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:46.141
- Dude, some guy just called for you.
- Who was it?

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:47.392
I don't know.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.270
How about
"Thanks for taking the message"? Jeez.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:53.148
Hey, listen.

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.567
When you move in,
Rachel's room's gonna be empty.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.861
You wanna talk
about what we wanna do with it?

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.071
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.406
I think we should have
a beautiful guest room...

00:04:01.574 --> 00:04:05.327
...with a mahogany sleigh bed
and bedside tables with flowers on them.

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:08.038
Then we could have a rolltop desk
with comment cards...

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:11.541
...so people can tell us
how much they love staying here.

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.420
Whatever, you know,
I really haven't thought about it that much.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.882
Well, I like that idea, obviously. Ha, ha.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.552
But I was thinking maybe
it could be a game room, you know?

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.554
I mean, you can buy old arcade games...

00:04:24.722 --> 00:04:27.891
...like "Space Invaders"
and "Asteroids" for $200.

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:30.269
The real ones. The big, big, big ones.

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:33.730
No.

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:38.610
Okay, so you mean "no" as in,
"Gee, Chandler, what an interesting idea.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:41.655
Let's discuss it
before we reject it completely."

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:43.991
Oh. I'm sorry. Of course.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:48.745
Yes. Interesting idea,
um, talk about it, but no.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.581
So that's it?

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:55.419
Well, I just don't think that arcade games
go in the beautiful guest room.

00:04:55.586 --> 00:04:57.963
The guest room's gonna be filled
with antiques.

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:01.675
Which is why "Asteroids" is perfect.
It's the oldest game.

00:05:03.594 --> 00:05:05.429
What do you have
against the guest room?

00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:07.639
I don't have anything
against the guest room.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:11.518
Especially since everybody that we know
lives about 30 seconds away.

00:05:12.937 --> 00:05:14.062
Are you mocking me?

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.690
No, I'm not mocking you
or your beautiful guest room.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.905
What's up?

00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:26.199
Nothing. Monica and I had a stupid fight.

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:29.786
But you're still moving in together, right?
Because my ad came out today.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:34.291
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

00:05:37.211 --> 00:05:38.712
- Nice.
- Ah?

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:40.505
I figured after living with you...

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:43.508
...it'd be an interesting change
to have a female roommate.

00:05:43.676 --> 00:05:47.304
You know? Someone I could learn from.
Someone who's different than me.

00:05:47.472 --> 00:05:51.141
And what's more different than me,
a guy who's not 19...

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.810
...than, say, a girl who is 19?

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.520
Ah? Ha, ha.

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:57.814
Not just a hat rack, my friend.

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:04.071
- Pheebs, I have to ask you...
- Shh. I'm swamped right now.

00:06:04.989 --> 00:06:07.199
You're just staring into space.

00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:10.744
Um, I'm trying to move that pencil.

00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:13.747
- This one?
- It worked!

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:18.835
Pheebs, this whole apartment thing
is a nightmare.

00:06:19.003 --> 00:06:22.089
Every place that I can afford
comes with a roommate who is a freak.

00:06:22.256 --> 00:06:23.882
Look at this.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.428
"Wanted: Female roommate,
nonsmoker, nonugly."

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:35.018
- It's just there's nothing. This city is full.
- Wait, no, look at this.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.521
"Two-bedroom, two-bath.
Must be nonsmoker.

00:06:37.688 --> 00:06:40.399
Satan worshipers okay."

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.693
Oh. Yeah, but it's on the ground floor.

00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:47.114
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:06:47.281 --> 00:06:50.283
- Rach, are you still looking for a place?
- Yeah, why?

00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:52.661
Okay, there's this guy Warren
from the museum...

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:55.205
...and he's going on a dig
for like two years.

00:06:55.748 --> 00:06:58.041
And he's got this great place
he needs to sublet.

00:06:58.209 --> 00:06:59.918
So you interested?

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:03.505
That sounds great.
I'd love to live at Warren's. I love Warren.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.882
- Thank you.
- Oh, don't thank me.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:08.093
You wanna thank someone,
thank the volcano...

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.178
...that erupted thousands of years ago...

00:07:10.346 --> 00:07:13.890
...killing but perfectly preserving
an entire civilization.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:17.060
Here's Warren's number.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:20.689
Oh, this is great.
I am gonna call him right now.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:23.066
- Oh, okay. Oh.
- Thank you. Ha, ha.

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:27.988
Okay, you go call him.

00:07:29.198 --> 00:07:30.240
I saw it.

00:07:31.951 --> 00:07:34.202
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.205
I'm talking about that which you already
know but won't admit.

00:07:37.373 --> 00:07:39.958
You know, that you love her again.
You relove her.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.961
Look, I do not relove her.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:46.047
I can't believe you won't just admit it.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.593
Okay, just promise me
that you won't do anything stupid.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.638
Look, we're just friends now, okay?
Why would I do anything stupid?

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:57.017
Ugh. Well, the apartment
is already subletted.

00:07:57.185 --> 00:08:00.103
I mean, this is just hopeless.
I'm never gonna find anything.

00:08:00.938 --> 00:08:01.980
You can live with me.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.273
- What?
- What?

00:08:05.109 --> 00:08:06.610
What?

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.658
- Oh, my God, are you serious?
- Uh-huh.

00:08:15.369 --> 00:08:18.413
I would love to live with you, Ross.
That's great. Thank you.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.957
I'm just glad I could,
you know, help you out.

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:27.380
Wow, I'm so happy for you guys.
This is so, so not stupid.

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:32.594
Ross, Ross, you have no idea
what this means to me.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:37.057
I mean, I was gonna be homeless.
You've just saved me. You're my hero.

00:08:38.476 --> 00:08:41.019
Hero? I don't know. Well, all right.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:45.732
Oh. I have to go tell Monica
what a wonderful brother she has.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.152
- Aw. Mwah.
- Oh, please.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:58.495
You're gonna say things now, aren't you?

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.498
No. No, I won't.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:03.625
But I should tell you this.

00:09:03.793 --> 00:09:06.586
This exact same thing happened
to my roommate, Denise.

00:09:06.754 --> 00:09:07.963
She moved in with a guy...

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.758
...who was secretly married to her
and said he didn't love her but really did.

00:09:11.926 --> 00:09:12.968
It just blew up.

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:15.971
And that's how she ended up
living with me.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:20.684
Okay, that's a lie.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.939
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:29.442
Hi. Listen, I'm sorry about before.
I don't need to have a game room.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.988
When I was a kid, I only played
those games because I couldn't get girls.

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:35.115
Now I can get...

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:36.908
Now I have you.

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.704
No, not that I think that I have you...

00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:44.165
...or think of you as property
in any sort of way.

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:46.251
- I see women...
- Stop it, Chandler.

00:09:48.546 --> 00:09:49.629
I'm sorry too.

00:09:50.548 --> 00:09:53.091
- Really?
- Yeah. Oh, yes.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.801
Oh.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.803
Listen, we don't have to make that
a guest room.

00:09:56.971 --> 00:09:59.347
- We can think of something together.
- That's a great idea.

00:09:59.515 --> 00:10:02.475
We can easily think of a way
for us both to enjoy the room.

00:10:02.643 --> 00:10:04.561
Totally.

00:10:09.358 --> 00:10:12.485
- We don't have to come up with this now.
- Oh, good.

00:10:12.653 --> 00:10:16.197
Why don't we think about changes
that we can make in the living room?

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:17.907
Changes?

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:21.244
Yeah, I mean, we're gonna have to move
some furniture to make room for my chair.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.333
You're gonna bring the Barcalounger
over here?

00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:29.502
- Is that a problem?
- Well...

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:33.173
It's just that they're a set
and they should probably stay together.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:36.259
Oh, that's cool.
Then I'll just bring them both over.

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:39.971
See, now you're taking them away
from their home.

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:43.975
Okay, I get it. So I get nothing.
Nothing here is mine. Everything is yours.

00:10:44.143 --> 00:10:47.729
I'll get up in the morning,
put on your clothes, and head off to work.

00:10:47.897 --> 00:10:50.065
Yeah. Yeah, you know what?
That's it. That's it.

00:10:50.232 --> 00:10:52.609
Everything will be mine.
Nothing will be yours.

00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.986
Oh, come on.
I'm talking about the Barcalounger.

00:10:55.237 --> 00:10:57.405
It doesn't match. Where is it gonna go?

00:10:57.573 --> 00:10:59.282
In the game room.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:02.827
Look, it is not my fault
that your chairs are incredibly ugly.

00:11:02.995 --> 00:11:06.956
That's fine. I won't bring over the chairs.
I won't bring anything over.

00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:10.835
I wouldn't wanna ruin the ambiance
over here at Grandma's place!

00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:15.173
Everything on your application
looks really good.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.133
Oh, just one last question.

00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:20.595
Are you and your friends
gonna be over here all the time partying?

00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:22.722
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not really a party girl.

00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:24.557
Whoa.

00:11:25.434 --> 00:11:28.520
Now, don't just be blurting stuff out.

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:32.023
I want you to really think
about your answers.

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:36.861
You can call off the roommate search.
Hi. I'll be living here.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:38.154
Oh, don't listen to him.

00:11:38.322 --> 00:11:40.281
He's just some guy
who wants the apartment.

00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:42.784
But I don't think he's gonna get it.

00:11:43.452 --> 00:11:45.829
Why did you take
the shower curtain down?

00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:47.455
That thing was a hazard.

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:50.250
I'm very safety-conscious.

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.760
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:12:00.928 --> 00:12:03.304
Oh, I was just clearing some space
for your stuff.

00:12:03.472 --> 00:12:04.556
Oh, thanks.

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:06.433
But listen, I was just at Monica's...

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.686
...and she and Chandler had a big fight
and they're not moving in.

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:14.315
What do you mean, not moving in?
They're still moving in, right?

00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:18.653
No, no, they just had a big blowout
over what to do with my room.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:21.489
What? Over a stupid room?

00:12:21.657 --> 00:12:23.032
I feel kind of bad for them...

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.119
...but I'm also psyched
because I don't have to move in here.

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:28.913
Oh, no. Yeah. No, that part's great.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.669
What's all this about you guys fighting?

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:37.130
Is this really over a room?

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:39.966
I mean, that is so silly.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:44.637
- Ross, we can handle this.
- Well, apparently not.

00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:49.726
And I can't just stand by and watch
two people I care about so much...

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:53.271
...be hurt by something that is so silly.

00:12:55.691 --> 00:13:00.361
- I mean, enough of the silliness.
- Why don't you tell her to stop being silly?

00:13:02.823 --> 00:13:04.741
Okay, okay.

00:13:06.243 --> 00:13:08.995
Two very good points.

00:13:09.914 --> 00:13:13.249
Look, I've known you both a long time.

00:13:13.417 --> 00:13:16.920
And I've never seen either of you
one-millionth as happy...

00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:19.464
...as you've been since you got together.

00:13:20.633 --> 00:13:24.385
Do you really wanna throw that all away
over a room?

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:26.846
That is so silly.

00:13:27.389 --> 00:13:30.642
What's more important, love...

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.310
...or silliness?

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.815
Well, we are fond of the silliness.

00:13:36.982 --> 00:13:39.400
But we also have a soft spot for the love.

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:42.821
- Love is the best medicine.
- That's laughter.

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:44.906
- Why do you do it?
- I don't know.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:53.873
Now, Chandler,
you wanna live with Monica, right?

00:13:55.125 --> 00:13:56.543
Yeah, I do.

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:59.045
And, Mon, you wanna live with Chandler,
don't you?

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:00.380
Yes.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:04.217
Good. A verbal contract is binding
in the state of New York.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.729
So I understand
you're looking for a place?

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:21.359
- No, no, I'm staying put.
- Oh.

00:14:23.028 --> 00:14:26.489
I was going to offer you my apartment.

00:14:27.449 --> 00:14:29.242
Why? Where are you going?

00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:31.786
I don't know.

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:36.916
- Hey, Rach.
- Hi.

00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:40.378
Uh, you're never gonna believe it.
Monica and Chandler are moving in again.

00:14:40.546 --> 00:14:44.007
That's great news, right?
I mean, for them, right?

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:45.884
Oh, wow.

00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:49.178
But on the bright side,
we get to be roommates again.

00:14:49.972 --> 00:14:53.558
Yeah. You know, about that, um...

00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:59.314
Ross, ahem, I really appreciate your offer
to let me move in and everything...

00:14:59.481 --> 00:15:01.441
...but don't you think
it's gonna be weird?

00:15:02.776 --> 00:15:07.322
Why? Why? Why would it...?
Why would it be weird?

00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:10.408
Well, you know, because of us.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.493
Because of our history.

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:14.871
- No.
- No?

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:17.081
No, no.

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:20.501
It would only be weird
if we were still in that place.

00:15:20.669 --> 00:15:24.339
I mean, are you still in that place?

00:15:24.506 --> 00:15:27.759
- No, not at all.
- Good. Me neither.

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:29.552
So it's not a problem.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:33.097
We're just two friends
who happen to be roommates.

00:15:33.265 --> 00:15:36.601
Okay, but, Ross,
eventually, you and I are gonna be dating.

00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:41.689
Really? We are?

00:15:41.857 --> 00:15:45.276
Well, yeah. I'm gonna have a boyfriend
and you're gonna have a girlfriend.

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:47.862
Oh. Heh.

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:50.698
That'd be great.

00:15:50.866 --> 00:15:54.285
But if you think it's gonna be okay,
we'll just work out a system.

00:15:54.453 --> 00:15:57.956
It'll be like in college. I'll hang a hanger
on the door and put a sign:

00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:00.166
"Come back later. I'm getting lucky."

00:16:06.465 --> 00:16:09.300
Yeah, I didn't think of that.

00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:15.223
So are you sure
about this whole moving-in thing?

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:20.311
I mean, it's a really big step.
And what's the rush?

00:16:23.857 --> 00:16:25.358
That's very funny.

00:16:25.526 --> 00:16:28.319
He's being silly
because he knows we enjoy the silliness.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:33.574
No, I'm serious, okay?
I mean, think about it.

00:16:33.742 --> 00:16:38.162
You move in, you start fighting
over stupid game rooms...

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.081
...next thing you know, you break up.

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:43.459
Ross, you were right before.
It was just a stupid fight about a room.

00:16:43.627 --> 00:16:45.211
Okay, there are no stupid fights.

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:48.798
This isn't about the room.

00:16:48.966 --> 00:16:52.510
This is about what the room represents.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:56.889
And unfortunately,
this room could destroy you.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:00.727
- Yeah, I'm not so worried.
- Yeah, no, me neither.

00:17:00.894 --> 00:17:03.396
Fine. It's your life.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:05.940
I just don't wanna see you break up.

00:17:06.108 --> 00:17:10.028
Which you will do
if you move in together.

00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:15.491
But if that's what you want,
there's nothing I can do.

00:17:15.659 --> 00:17:17.660
Don't do it!

00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:25.043
- You still wanna move in together, right?
- Of course.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.627
Ross didn't scare you?

00:17:26.795 --> 00:17:29.380
Scared me out of ever wanting
to live with him.

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:33.593
- Come here, I gotta show you something.
- Okay.

00:17:36.221 --> 00:17:38.181
Oh, my God,
someone's killed Square Man.

00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:42.977
This is where the Barcalounger could go.

00:17:43.145 --> 00:17:46.731
You see, you can see the TV, and still,
it's walking distance to the kitchen.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:49.692
Oh, that's so sweet.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.235
I wanna show you something.

00:17:51.403 --> 00:17:54.822
You know those big road signs
that say "merge"?

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.407
Mm-hm.

00:17:56.575 --> 00:17:58.993
You know? So I was thinking
we could get one of those signs...

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:01.287
...and hang it over our bed.

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:05.083
Because that's you and I together.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.417
"Merge."

00:18:08.295 --> 00:18:10.254
- Oh, my God, I love that.
- Really?

00:18:10.422 --> 00:18:12.173
"No."

00:18:15.094 --> 00:18:18.346
I found you in my bed

00:18:18.514 --> 00:18:21.182
How'd you wind up there?

00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:24.352
You are a mystery

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:29.982
Little black curly hair

00:18:30.567 --> 00:18:33.152
Little black, little black
Little black, little black

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:38.241
Little black curly hair

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:41.285
Thank you.

00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:43.663
Um...

00:18:43.831 --> 00:18:46.541
If you wanna receive e-mails
about my upcoming shows...

00:18:46.708 --> 00:18:50.253
...then please give me money
so I can buy a computer.

00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:55.466
So, uh... Ahem.

00:18:55.634 --> 00:18:57.552
Where are the other guys?

00:18:57.719 --> 00:19:00.179
Well, let's see,
Monica and Chandler are occupied.

00:19:00.347 --> 00:19:01.931
- Fighting?
- No, the other thing.

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:06.060
I really think it's great
they worked things out.

00:19:06.228 --> 00:19:09.063
Yeah, there's no breaking them up,
is there?

00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:13.067
Hey, can I borrow the key to your house
so I can make a copy?

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:15.736
- Here.
- Thank you.

00:19:15.904 --> 00:19:16.946
Now, are you sure?

00:19:17.114 --> 00:19:20.241
Because once I make a copy,
there's no turning back.

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:22.076
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:25.955
Now get out of here
before I change my mind.

00:19:29.126 --> 00:19:32.086
Uh, listen, Ross.

00:19:32.254 --> 00:19:35.173
You really think this moving in with Rachel
is a good idea?

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:37.800
I've been back and forth.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.179
Yeah, well,
maybe you should go back, okay?

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:43.306
Rachel moves in,
and before you know it...

00:19:43.473 --> 00:19:45.850
...you're where you don't wanna be,
back together.

00:19:46.018 --> 00:19:47.518
Yeah, I don't think so.

00:19:47.686 --> 00:19:50.354
She's already talking about,
you know, dating other guys.

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:51.856
That's not gonna work out.

00:19:52.024 --> 00:19:55.401
Then she's gonna come home all weepy,
and you'll be telling her:

00:19:55.569 --> 00:19:57.612
"Oh, that's okay. You'll find someone."

00:19:57.779 --> 00:20:00.990
And then, bam, she finds you.

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:05.536
Huh. Oh, maybe you're right.

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:09.207
I am telling you, Ross, she is definitely
gonna fall in love with you again.

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:10.666
Now, is that what you want?

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:14.420
- Heh. Is that what I want?
- Yes.

00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:19.884
Here she comes.
I'm gonna make your life much easier.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:23.012
All right, well, the place was closed,
so I'll copy it later.

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:24.388
Or not.

00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:27.141
Uh, Rach, why don't you just move in
with me?

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:28.684
- Ahh.
- Oh.

00:20:28.852 --> 00:20:32.021
- Whoa, whoa, Joey.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:37.526
Look, Rach, I know I scared you off
with that whole naked-Thursdays thing...

00:20:38.487 --> 00:20:40.947
...but we don't have to do that.

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:45.117
Well, it would be easier
to move just right across the hall.

00:20:46.203 --> 00:20:49.830
Wait a minute, unless you're thinking
about naked Wednesdays.

00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:53.584
Thursday's clearly not good for you.
Pick a day.

00:20:59.716 --> 00:21:00.758
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:03.511
Come on in. Thanks for coming back.

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:06.305
Okay, there have been a lot of people
interested in the room.

00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:09.308
But I have narrowed it down,
and you are one of the finalists.

00:21:09.476 --> 00:21:11.978
- Great.
- Okay, now, before I make my decision...

00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:15.356
...I just wanna make sure
that our personalities match, okay?

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:16.816
So I made up a little test.

00:21:16.984 --> 00:21:21.070
Now, I'm gonna say a word, and then
you say the first thing that comes to mind.

00:21:21.238 --> 00:21:23.948
- I can do that.
- Okay, here we go.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:25.533
- Pillow.
- Fight.

00:21:25.993 --> 00:21:27.535
Very good.

00:21:28.412 --> 00:21:30.663
Okay. G.

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:32.999
- String?
- Excellent.

00:21:34.543 --> 00:21:36.585
Okay. Um...

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:38.838
Doggy.

00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:43.259
- Kitten?
- Ooh, sorry.

00:21:44.845 --> 00:21:48.139
No, no, no. So close, though.
But, you know, okay, bye-bye.
