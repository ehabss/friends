WEBVTT

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:05.337
Monica, which of all of this
kitchen stuff is mine?

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:07.840
This bottle opener.

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:11.260
- And?
- And it's a magnet.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.683
Look at that.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.978
How weird is that?
You know, you're moving in with me...

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.273
...and you have the one thing
I don't have. Ha, ha.

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:29.403
It's like, in a way, you complete me.
Huh?

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:33.365
- Kitchen.
- What?

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.243
You complete me kitchen, matey.

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:41.165
- Ross, I know what you're thinking.
- What?

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:43.167
That she's gonna move in with you...

00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:45.335
...and then maybe fall in love with you,
and then...

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:49.256
...when she finds out you're already
married, oh, she'll be happy.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:52.217
You know? You're just... You're very sad.

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.721
Oh, my God.

00:00:56.931 --> 00:01:01.894
I see what this is.
You are in love with Rachel.

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:05.230
- What?
- Of course. It all adds up.

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:07.274
I mean, you're obsessed with her.
It's always:

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:09.193
"Ross, what are you gonna do
about Rachel?

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.487
Ross, why are you moving in
with Rachel?

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.281
When are you gonna confess
your secret marriage to Rachel?"

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:17.868
- You want her.
- No!

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:21.747
Uh-oh. Saved by the bell.

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:23.916
Hello.

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:27.377
Hey, Rach.
Aren't these candlesticks mine?

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:28.879
No, no, I bought those.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.049
- Oh, right. I forgot.
- Yeah.

00:01:32.217 --> 00:01:34.009
That you're a liar.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:40.057
No, no, that's great. I'll be there Monday.
And thank you again.

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:41.725
Okay.

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:45.479
Um, that was the head
of the paleontology department...

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:49.525
...at NYU.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:53.737
Wow. What did he say?

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:59.284
Uh, remember that paper I had published
last year on sediment flow rate?

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:02.246
- Well, they loved it.
- Well, who wouldn't?

00:02:03.123 --> 00:02:04.998
I know!

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.211
Anyway, they asked me
to be a guest lecturer.

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.007
I mean, it's temporary, but if they like me,
it could lead to a full-time job.

00:02:14.175 --> 00:02:17.678
How great would that look
on the mailbox, huh? Professor Geller.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:20.139
Yeah. Professor and Mrs.

00:02:21.808 --> 00:02:23.058
And Mrs?

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.937
Oh, yeah, you know,
you and Ross are still married.

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:29.815
What?

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.818
Just kidding.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:36.864
Oh, God.

00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.161
Saved your ass.

00:03:20.825 --> 00:03:22.367
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:23.660
- Hey.
- What's the matter?

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:25.954
Well, ahem.

00:03:26.122 --> 00:03:28.248
- You know that psychic I see?
- Yeah?

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:30.500
She told me
that I'm gonna die this week...

00:03:30.668 --> 00:03:32.502
...so I'm kind of bummed about that.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.089
- What?
- I know you don't know about readings...

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:39.218
...but that one is pretty much
the worst one you can get.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.012
Phoebe, that's crazy.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.805
I can't believe she'd say that to you?

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:45.724
Yeah, honey,
you don't believe her, do you?

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.936
I don't know.
She, you know, said that I'd have triplets...

00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:51.188
...but she also said one of them
would be black.

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:52.606
Oh.

00:03:53.483 --> 00:03:55.984
Just out of curiosity,
did she tell you how you were gonna go?

00:03:56.152 --> 00:03:59.321
No, because she didn't tell me
I was gonna die till the end of the session.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.032
And I was not gonna waste
a whole other hour there.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.909
I mean, I've only got a week left,
you know?

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.787
I've really gotta start living now.

00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:12.501
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, hi.

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.504
- Hey.
- Hey. Well, today's my first lecture...

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.632
...and I kind of wanted to try it out
on you guys. Do you mind?

00:04:21.594 --> 00:04:22.761
No, that'd be great.

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:25.305
Okay.

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:37.818
"There are three primary theories
concerning sediment flow rate.

00:04:37.986 --> 00:04:41.530
Each of these theories can be further
subcategorized into two..."

00:04:41.698 --> 00:04:44.449
Oh, this is it.
This is what's gonna kill me.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:51.331
"...subcategories.
The first of these subcategories is..."

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.125
Um, Ross? Heh.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:55.877
Are there, uh, naked chicks
on that piece of paper?

00:04:58.506 --> 00:04:59.548
No. Why?

00:04:59.716 --> 00:05:02.134
Well, I just never seen a guy
stare so hard at paper...

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:03.844
...that didn't have naked chicks on it.

00:05:05.263 --> 00:05:09.433
Oh, okay. Okay.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.771
"There are three primary theories...

00:05:16.524 --> 00:05:19.443
...concerning sediment flow rate.

00:05:21.654 --> 00:05:23.572
Each of these theories...

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.826
...can be further subcategorized into..."

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.037
Why don't you open with a joke?

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:35.083
Open with a joke?
It's a university, not a comedy club.

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:37.210
Wait a minute, hold the phone.

00:05:38.212 --> 00:05:40.297
You're not talking about
Chuckles University?

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.716
Okay.

00:05:42.884 --> 00:05:44.426
Come on, we're kidding.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.636
You know what might make it
less boring?

00:05:46.804 --> 00:05:48.096
Thank you.

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:51.016
Some, um... Some visual aids.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:52.851
Oh, oh!
You know what's a good visual aid?

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.895
Please don't say naked chicks.

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.522
Why not?

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:01.151
I don't even know why I bothered
to even talk to you guys about it.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:04.613
You know, I'm just gonna do it on my own,
with no naked chicks.

00:06:04.781 --> 00:06:07.574
That's the way I did it till I was 19.

00:06:13.164 --> 00:06:14.289
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:15.916
Any good mail?

00:06:16.084 --> 00:06:18.293
Yes, you got something
from the Screen Actors Guild.

00:06:18.461 --> 00:06:22.422
Ooh, it's probably a residual check.
Hey, can you open it? I got...

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:27.219
- "Benefits lapsed."
- Hmm. That's weird.

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:30.430
I don't remember being in a movie
called Benefits Lapsed.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:32.516
Okay, it's not a check.

00:06:32.683 --> 00:06:35.852
They're saying your health insurance
expired because...

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.563
...you didn't work enough last year.
- Let me see that.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:40.107
All right.

00:06:40.274 --> 00:06:42.734
Oh, I can't believe this.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:44.653
This sucks.

00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:47.489
When I had insurance,
I could get hit by a bus...

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:50.158
...or catch on fire, you know?

00:06:50.326 --> 00:06:53.245
And it wouldn't matter.
Now I gotta be careful?

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:57.290
I'm sorry, man.
There's never a good time to have to...

00:06:57.458 --> 00:06:59.793
...stop catching on fire.

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.671
All right, well...

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.298
...I guess I gotta go get a job.
I'm gonna see my agent.

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:08.343
Okay, make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street.

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.139
"Make sure to look both ways
before you cross the street."

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.523
- Hey.
- Hey, Pheebs, you're still alive.

00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:25.068
How are you feeling?

00:07:25.236 --> 00:07:27.946
It's so exhausting, waiting for death.

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:30.699
Oh, by the way, do you think you...

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.746
Pheebs, what are you doing?

00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:39.541
I was preparing you for...
Didn't you think I was dead?

00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.293
Did that not come off?

00:07:42.336 --> 00:07:46.089
Oh, yeah, scared the hell out of me.
I thought we'd lost you forever.

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:49.050
- Pheebs, you wanna lie down?
- Yeah, thanks.

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:51.344
And listen, can you do me a favor?

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:53.472
Could you just wake me up
in a couple hours.

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:55.724
You know, if you can.

00:07:59.937 --> 00:08:01.646
Monica?

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:05.650
Did you take these back?

00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:10.697
No, no. I just liked them so much
that I went out and bought some for myself.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.116
Oh, yeah, they're really great,
aren't they?

00:08:13.284 --> 00:08:14.743
- I love them.
- Yeah.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.037
Nice try.

00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:21.917
- Hello.
- Hey, how'd the lecture go?

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:24.336
It went great.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:28.423
And I didn't need any jokes
or naked chicks either.

00:08:28.591 --> 00:08:31.635
Oh, that's great. I'm sorry
we weren't supportive before.

00:08:31.802 --> 00:08:34.971
I knew all I had to do
was let the material speak for itself.

00:08:35.139 --> 00:08:38.225
Everyone's all, uh,
"Ross, you have to be funny and sexy."

00:08:38.392 --> 00:08:40.602
Well, I proved them wrong.

00:08:41.812 --> 00:08:44.648
And now I'm gonna pass
the news on to Joey and Chandler.

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:47.609
- That you're not funny or sexy?
- That's right.

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:57.244
- Hey, Estelle, listen...
- Well, well, well.

00:08:57.411 --> 00:08:58.912
Joey Tribbiani.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.206
So you came back, huh?

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.792
They think they can do better,
but they all...

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.962
...come crawling back to Estelle.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.549
What are you talking about?

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.426
I never left you.
You've always been my agent.

00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:15.679
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:19.224
Oh, well, no harm, no foul.

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:24.145
Look, Estelle, you gotta get me some work.
I lost my health insurance.

00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:27.607
All right, first thing we gotta do:
Damage control.

00:09:27.775 --> 00:09:30.318
- Why?
- Well, I think, uh...

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:32.779
...someone out there...

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:36.449
...may have been bad-mouthing you
all over town.

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:39.494
The bastard.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:49.045
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:53.091
So Estelle lined up a bunch
of auditions for me tomorrow.

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:56.177
And I'll have my health insurance
back in no time.

00:09:57.346 --> 00:10:00.890
That's great, but shouldn't you
be on the toilet right now?

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:06.855
- What?
- What's wrong with you?

00:10:07.023 --> 00:10:08.023
Nothing.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:13.028
Well, I got this blinding pain in my stomach
when I was lifting weights before.

00:10:13.195 --> 00:10:15.155
And then I, uh, passed out...

00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:18.575
...and, uh, I haven't been able
to stand up since. Ha, ha.

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:21.536
But I don't think it's anything serious.

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:24.706
This sounds like a hernia.
You have to... Go to the doctor.

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:26.124
No way.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.043
If I'm gonna go to the doctor
for anything...

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:31.463
...it's gonna be for this thing
sticking out of my stomach.

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:36.009
That's a hernia.

00:10:36.177 --> 00:10:39.054
Why'd I have to start
working out again?

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.556
Damn you, 15s.

00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:48.104
We're a little early.
The lecture doesn't end for 15 minutes.

00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:50.732
- Yeah, but we can sneak in and watch.
- Yeah. Good.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:53.610
Oh, hey, look.
There's some Kappa Kappa Deltas.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:56.863
I was a Kappa. Hey, sisters.

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.409
Wow, we really are bitches.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:07.165
Right. So when Rigby got his samples...

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:08.833
...back from the laboratory...

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:11.670
...he made a startling discovery.

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.760
What he believed to be igneous
was, in fact, sedimentary.

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:22.597
Imagine his consternation when...

00:11:26.602 --> 00:11:28.645
Oh, bloody hell.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.735
What the hell are you doing?

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.279
Look, I was nervous.

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:41.116
You guys had me all worried
I was gonna be boring.

00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:44.744
I got up there and they were
all, like, staring at me.

00:11:44.912 --> 00:11:48.623
I opened my mouth and this
British accent just came out.

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:51.501
Yeah, and not a very good one.

00:11:51.669 --> 00:11:53.712
Will you, please?

00:11:53.879 --> 00:11:55.755
Dr. Geller? Kurt Rathman.

00:11:55.923 --> 00:11:58.383
I'm a professor in the paleontology
department here.

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.553
Do you have a moment
to talk about your lecture?

00:12:01.762 --> 00:12:04.723
I'm sorry, I've got plans with my sister.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.891
Monica Geller.

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:11.938
Right. Will you excuse us
for one moment?

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:13.523
What are you doing?

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:15.817
You can have an accent, but I can't?

00:12:15.985 --> 00:12:18.278
Top of the morning to you, laddies.

00:12:18.446 --> 00:12:20.989
Would you just please stop?

00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:23.074
Yes.

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:26.286
Bombay is very, very nice
this time of year.

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:44.929
Hey, will you grab me a cruller?

00:12:46.724 --> 00:12:48.057
Sit down.

00:12:49.018 --> 00:12:53.104
- Will you go to the hospital?
- Dude, hernia operations cost, like...

00:12:53.272 --> 00:12:55.106
...a lot probably, okay?

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:57.692
Besides, it's getting darker
and more painful.

00:12:57.860 --> 00:12:59.861
That means it's healing.

00:13:00.738 --> 00:13:02.614
Look, I will loan you the money.

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:06.367
Just go to the hospital and
let's just get that thing...

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:08.369
...pushed back in.

00:13:08.537 --> 00:13:11.790
Thank you, but it'd take me
forever to pay you that money back.

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:14.375
And I don't want that
hanging over my head, okay?

00:13:14.543 --> 00:13:16.586
Besides, as soon as my insurance
kicks in...

00:13:16.754 --> 00:13:19.631
...I can get all the free operations I want.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:22.884
I think I'll probably start
with that laser eye surgery.

00:13:25.387 --> 00:13:26.596
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:13:26.764 --> 00:13:28.223
- Hey.
- What's going on?

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:29.891
Well, Joey's got a bad hernia...

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:33.228
...but it's nothing a little
laser eye surgery won't fix.

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:37.106
Look, I'm telling you, if I put my hand
on my stomach right here...

00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:39.442
...it doesn't hurt that bad. Ah.

00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:42.320
Hey, maybe you'll die.

00:13:43.948 --> 00:13:45.824
Chandler, I'm scared.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:47.826
No, we can go together.

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:49.369
Just don't wait too long, though...

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:52.038
...because I'm out of here
sometime before Friday.

00:13:53.123 --> 00:13:54.707
But I don't want to die.

00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:55.875
No, no. It'll be fun.

00:13:56.043 --> 00:13:58.169
We can come back
and we can haunt these guys.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:06.386
- Give me them.
- No, they are mine.

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.680
- You stole them from me.
- You stole them from me.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.431
Give me them.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:14.644
You just wanna each take one?

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:17.897
Yeah, that seems fair.
We never use them.

00:14:19.608 --> 00:14:22.318
Look, I really need some help, okay?

00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:26.406
Why? Why did I have to speak
in a British accent?

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:28.032
What do I do?

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.744
Well, why don't you phase it out?
Yeah, phase the accent out.

00:14:31.912 --> 00:14:35.039
People will think that you're
adjusting to life in America.

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:37.625
Yeah, I mean, come on.
No one will even notice.

00:14:37.793 --> 00:14:40.211
I mean, they're probably
not even listening to you.

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:43.840
They're not listening to me?

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.843
Of course they're listening to you.

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:48.511
Everybody listens to you.

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:52.390
Monica, do you really think I should
try this phasing-out thing?

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:54.183
I think you look fine.

00:14:58.188 --> 00:15:00.565
- Whenever you're ready.
- Okay.

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.610
Hey, Timmy.

00:15:04.153 --> 00:15:06.738
I've got a surprise...

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.448
...for you.

00:15:08.616 --> 00:15:10.283
Hold it. I'm sorry.

00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:13.953
The surprise is a new swing set.
If you could play it less intense.

00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:18.166
Oh, yeah. Sure, no problem.
Just hold on one second.

00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:26.966
Hey, Timmy.

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:30.553
I've got a surprise for you.

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:31.721
Oh, my God!

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:41.773
So that's why I feed my dog Purina One.

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.608
Pick up a bag today.

00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:48.321
- That's where you pick up the bag.
- Exactly.

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:53.284
No, the line is, "Pick up a bag,"
so you need to pick up the bag.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:56.829
Or I could just point to it. Huh?

00:15:56.997 --> 00:16:01.960
Blah, blah, blah. Purina One.
Point to a bag today.

00:16:05.965 --> 00:16:07.465
- I didn't get it, did I?
- No.

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:08.925
Yeah, okay.

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:13.513
Hi.

00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:15.431
I'm Joey Tribbiani.

00:16:15.599 --> 00:16:18.226
I'm here to audition for "Man."

00:16:19.144 --> 00:16:20.311
You mean "Dying Man."

00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:22.814
Yes.

00:16:24.858 --> 00:16:28.361
- Okay, come on. Do it one more time.
- Really? Really? Okay.

00:16:31.615 --> 00:16:33.449
Ross, this is Dr. McNeely...

00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:36.327
...from Fake Accent University.

00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:38.830
We'd like you to come on board
with us full-time.

00:16:42.334 --> 00:16:44.043
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:16:44.211 --> 00:16:45.628
Listen to this.

00:16:46.296 --> 00:16:48.506
My reading was wrong.
I'm not going to die.

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.592
- Really? How do you know?
- Because my psychic is dead.

00:16:53.929 --> 00:16:57.682
- She must have read the cards wrong.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:16:57.850 --> 00:16:59.767
Ah, better her than me.

00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:02.061
Hey, let's bake cookies!

00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:09.777
Listen, I'm really glad you got the part.

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:14.198
- Are you sure you can do this?
- Yeah.

00:17:14.366 --> 00:17:15.950
And, hey, thanks for coming with me.

00:17:16.118 --> 00:17:19.287
And thanks again
for helping me take a shower.

00:17:21.665 --> 00:17:25.209
Now, is that
"never talking about it again"?

00:17:27.254 --> 00:17:29.297
Hey, Joey. We're ready for you.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:32.175
Joey, this is Alex.
He's gonna be playing your son.

00:17:32.342 --> 00:17:33.551
Hi, Alex.

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.888
And, uh, as you can see,
my hands are not in my pants.

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:40.308
Okay.

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:44.687
All right, uh, Alex.
Now, when Joey says his line:

00:17:44.855 --> 00:17:48.816
"Take good care of your mama, son,"
that's your cue to cry. Got it?

00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:50.902
All right, let's do this.

00:17:54.531 --> 00:17:56.741
Scene five, take one.

00:17:58.243 --> 00:17:59.535
And action.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:12.423
Take good care of your mama, son.

00:18:16.303 --> 00:18:17.428
Come on, son.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.223
Your mama's good people.

00:18:20.974 --> 00:18:22.183
Cut.

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:25.186
Alex, remember,
you're supposed to cry.

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:27.605
- Can you cry for us this time?
- Okay.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.191
All right. From the top.

00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:35.154
Scene five, take two.

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:37.824
Take 36 is up.

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:40.201
Let's try this again.

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:41.702
You ready, Joe?

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.664
Uh, one thing,
is it all right with you if I scream...

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:46.749
...right up until you say, "Action"?

00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:48.793
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:54.590
- Action!
- Take good care of your mama, son.

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.095
- Cut.
- Aah!

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:02.348
I'm sorry. Hey, hey.
Joe, why don't you lift up your shirt?

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:04.392
Take a look at this, kiddo.

00:19:08.188 --> 00:19:11.357
We have a crying child!
Roll the damn cameras!

00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:18.739
- Hello.
- Hello, is Ross there?

00:19:18.907 --> 00:19:20.449
No, he's not. Can I take a message?

00:19:20.617 --> 00:19:23.035
Yes, this is Russell,
Ross' divorce lawyer.

00:19:23.203 --> 00:19:25.246
Just tell him that since
I haven't heard from him...

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:27.665
...I assume he's decided
to give the marriage a try.

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:31.127
Ross got married again? Aah! No.

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:37.133
All right, keep going.
We are phasing the accent out.

00:19:37.301 --> 00:19:39.218
Phasing it out.

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:43.973
"So without retesting their results
in the laboratory...

00:19:44.516 --> 00:19:47.685
...the team would never
have identified...

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:56.152
...the initial errors
in their carbon dating analysis."

00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:00.489
Were there any questions
at this point?

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:04.327
- Yes.
- What's happening to your accent?

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:10.124
Come again? What's this nonsense?

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.964
All right. I'm not English.

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.927
I'm from Long Island.

00:20:21.428 --> 00:20:23.846
I was really nervous, and the accent...

00:20:24.014 --> 00:20:25.806
...just, um... Just came out.

00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:28.184
Ha, ha. I'm sorry.

00:20:30.062 --> 00:20:33.022
So if we could just
get back to the lecture.

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.984
Um, were there any questions?

00:20:39.696 --> 00:20:41.322
About paleontology?

00:20:43.867 --> 00:20:47.703
All right, look, I was just trying
to make a good first impression.

00:20:47.871 --> 00:20:49.747
Obviously, I screwed up.

00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:52.083
But what you guys think of me
is really important...

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.294
...because I'm hoping
to get a permanent job here.

00:20:55.462 --> 00:20:58.839
So if you'd just give me another
chance to make a good impression...

00:21:00.425 --> 00:21:02.510
Ross. Are you crazy?

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:06.055
I am still your wife?
What, were you just never gonna tell me?

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:08.391
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:10.977
Ugh, I could just kill you!

00:21:16.024 --> 00:21:17.775
Well, hello, Rachel.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:29.662
- You've really done this before?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:32.456
You just take a big, big swing, okay?

00:21:32.624 --> 00:21:34.542
Now, don't hold back.

00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:39.005
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:40.381
