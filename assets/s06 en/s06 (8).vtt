00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:08.549
Hi, my name's Chandler.
I just moved in next door.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.760
Would you like to battle me
in a post-apocalyptic world...

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.723
...for control of the galaxy's
last remaining energy source?

00:00:16.558 --> 00:00:18.517
Sure, neighbor. Come on in.

00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:20.978
Is Janine around?

00:00:21.229 --> 00:00:22.646
She's at dance class.

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:24.148
Can I check my room?

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:27.234
Don't go through her stuff.
She gets really mad.

00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:32.614
Oh, my God.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:35.617
It's like a guy never lived in here.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:40.122
You gotta be careful. This girl
thing is dangerous. It's spreading.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.832
It is?

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.836
Is this your pretty pink pillow
on the couch?

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:47.004
No.

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:50.924
Is that your tiny little box that's
too small to put anything in?

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:52.176
- No.
- No.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.637
Okay, this is not good.
You are a guy, okay?

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.514
This is a "guy's" place.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.851
Soon, you'll be soaking
your fingers in stuff.

00:01:02.187 --> 00:01:05.606
- You're right. I'll talk to her.
- Talk to her. Be a man.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:07.649
- I'm a man.
- Defend yourself.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:11.320
We have to hem the new dust ruffle.

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:13.072
Be right there, sweetums.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.159
Totally different situation.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:00.327
Hey, guys.

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:02.496
- How was breakfast with Hillary?
- Okay.

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:06.375
She's still depressed because
she broke up with her boyfriend.

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:10.003
Is this Hillary,
your hot assistant chef, Hillary?

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:13.549
- Yeah.
- The one that stares at me?

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:17.719
No. The one who looked at you once
because you got in her way.

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:21.140
Still, I could tell. She was into me.

00:02:23.351 --> 00:02:24.643
Why don't you set us up?

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:26.562
Ooh, are you setting Ross up
with someone?

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:28.772
Does she have a wedding dress?

00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:32.693
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:37.614
Rachel, I'm making up flyers
to try to get new massage clients.

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:40.450
So can I come to Bloomingdale's
and use the copy machine?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.038
Well, sure, but they might think it's weird
considering I don't work there anymore.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:48.000
Oh, my God. What happened?

00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.127
I got a job at Ralph Lauren.

00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.796
Well, that's great. Congratulations.

00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:56.758
A year ago.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.387
You've lasted all year. Good for you.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.685
But, Pheebs, you could still use
the copy machine where I actually work.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.646
But come by at lunch
so my boss doesn't see you.

00:03:09.898 --> 00:03:12.107
Kim will freak out.
She already doesn't like me.

00:03:12.317 --> 00:03:15.694
- I don't think my boss likes me.
- I don't think mine likes me either.

00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:18.780
Maybe it's a universal thing.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.701
Or maybe because you're all hanging
around here at 11:30 on a Wednesday.

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:27.372
Yeah, let's head off to work.

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:34.671
- Thank you.
- Sure.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:36.673
You will not believe this.

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.801
I was making copies,
and Ralph Lauren came in.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:42.012
Oh, my God. Did you talk to him?

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.306
Yeah, a little. He seems really nice.

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:46.558
- Good kisser.
- What?

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.518
What?

00:03:48.978 --> 00:03:50.479
- You kissed him?
- Totally.

00:03:51.356 --> 00:03:53.148
Phoebe, are you serious?

00:03:53.358 --> 00:03:55.859
Yeah, I was just in there,
he came in and introduced himself.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:59.363
The next thing I know,
we're making out.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.616
Phoebe, you do know he's married?

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.284
No.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:05.911
Phoebe.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.581
What am I supposed to do, ask every guy
I make out with if he's married?

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.459
No, yeah, I should.

00:04:25.306 --> 00:04:26.807
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey.

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:30.686
Uh, can I talk to you for a second?
There's a kid in this picture.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:33.689
Do you, uh, know this kid?
Is it a relative?

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.816
No. I just thought it was cute.

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:39.194
Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.
Okay, uh...

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:42.281
Look, Janine, I really want you
to feel at home here, but...

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.409
...some of this new stuff,
it's too girlie.

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.577
Oh. Like what?

00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:51.290
Uh, like this.
Pictures of cute babies we don't know.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.250
We can't have that.

00:04:53.584 --> 00:04:56.253
Joey, it's Anne Geddes.
She's a famous artist.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:05:00.799
I don't know this baby.
I don't know if she's a famous artist or not.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:07.472
I don't want to be a jerk, but
you're changing too much around here.

00:05:07.682 --> 00:05:10.934
I'm sorry. I just thought
I'd try and make the place a little nicer.

00:05:11.144 --> 00:05:12.728
Yeah, but it's too much stuff.

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:17.274
You know, you got the candles and
the "foofy schmoofer" thing here.

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:21.445
Over here, you got
a picture of a watering can.

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:25.824
- I just thought...
- I'm sure it's a famous watering can.

00:05:26.034 --> 00:05:27.242
But come on.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.579
And what is with the really hot stick
in the bathroom?

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:33.373
It's a curling iron.

00:05:39.005 --> 00:05:41.673
Oh. Well, that's okay then.

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:45.344
Okay, my towels, for instance.
I come into the bathroom...

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:49.598
...and my towel is not on the floor,
where I keep it.

00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:54.728
It's up here on some hook.
And it smells different.

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.773
- It's clean.
- Yeah, well, it feels different.

00:05:57.982 --> 00:05:59.399
It's dry.

00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:04.654
All right, I can make my peace
with the clean, dry towels.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.282
Okay, also, what is with
these chips you bought?

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.078
No, no, no. It's potpourri.
You're supposed to smell it.

00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:21.088
Well, that's like summer in a bowl.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:32.766
Oh.

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:34.476
Kim, hi.

00:06:34.936 --> 00:06:36.311
Uh-huh.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:44.444
So I handed in that marketing report,
and I never got to hear what you thought.

00:06:44.862 --> 00:06:47.155
- I didn't read it.
- Ah.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:53.328
So, wow, the spring line's really
gonna be great this year, huh?

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:55.705
Yeah.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:03.338
So I hear, uh, Ralph Lauren fooled around
with someone in the copy room.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.092
Tell me everything.

00:07:10.805 --> 00:07:12.556
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.057
What's up?

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:18.019
You know...

00:07:18.312 --> 00:07:19.896
Oh, my God.

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:22.482
What happened to your teeth?

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.067
I whitened them.

00:07:26.654 --> 00:07:27.821
Really?

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:30.657
Yeah, what do you think?

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:33.452
I think I shouldn't look
directly at them.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.954
Come on, seriously.

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:42.210
- They're really, really, really white.
- What was wrong with your old...

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:44.129
...human teeth?

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:48.675
I did leave the gel on
a little longer than it said to.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.887
- How much longer?
- A day.

00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:55.515
Ross, tonight is your date with Hillary.

00:07:55.725 --> 00:07:59.728
I know. That's why I did it.
Are they really that bad?

00:08:00.771 --> 00:08:01.771
No. No, no, no.

00:08:01.981 --> 00:08:05.108
You'll be fine.
Hillary's blind, right?

00:08:05.985 --> 00:08:07.861
She will be after tonight.

00:08:10.323 --> 00:08:12.407
Oh, Rach.
Uh, do you notice anything...?

00:08:12.617 --> 00:08:15.118
Your teeth?
Yes, I saw them from outside.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:19.706
You guys are never gonna
believe this...

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:24.127
...but Phoebe made out
with Ralph Lauren.

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.629
- What?
- Oh, my God.

00:08:25.838 --> 00:08:29.341
She ran into him at my office,
and they just made out.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.469
The craziest thing is,
now my boss likes me because...

00:08:32.678 --> 00:08:35.138
...it's the best gossip
she's heard all year.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:38.099
I am proud of all my friends today.

00:08:39.018 --> 00:08:42.103
Rachel, I can't believe Phoebe
made out with Ralph Lauren.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.523
Ugh. I'm so jealous.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:48.026
Hi, I'm Chandler,
your live-in boyfriend.

00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:51.238
Chandler, please. Come on.

00:08:51.447 --> 00:08:52.906
Look at him.

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:56.868
Well, I am no woman,
but that is one tasty dish.

00:08:58.371 --> 00:08:59.454
Hey.

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:00.747
Here. Ooh.

00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:03.124
Who's the silver fox?

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:07.796
That is your make-out buddy.
Don't you recognize him?

00:09:08.047 --> 00:09:12.717
Oh, wait. "Ooh, Phoebe, I love you.
Kiss me, please."

00:09:13.386 --> 00:09:16.680
That's not Ralph Lauren.
It sounds like him, though.

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:18.390
What?

00:09:18.599 --> 00:09:20.892
Yeah, no, Ralph doesn't look
like that guy.

00:09:21.143 --> 00:09:25.939
He's young, and he's got long hair
and a beard and a Hacky Sack...

00:09:26.148 --> 00:09:30.318
Oh, my God. That's not Ralph Lauren.
That's Kenny the copy guy.

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.362
What?

00:09:32.572 --> 00:09:36.199
Oh, God... I told my boss that someone
made out with Ralph Lauren.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:40.704
If she finds out that I lied to her,
she is gonna hate me even more. Phoebe!

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:43.456
Why would the copy guy
say he's Ralph Lauren?

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.500
To get you to make out with him.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.127
Oh.

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.843
Okay, maybe this will make them
look less white.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:01.016
Nope. Heh.

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:04.060
Okay, so colors that don't work are...

00:10:04.312 --> 00:10:08.356
...blue, yellow, green, red, black,
white, orange and purple.

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:13.403
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
The date starts in an hour.

00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:18.992
Ross, maybe if your skin was lighter,
your teeth wouldn't look so bright.

00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:23.246
Oh, great. So all I need to do
is get some new skin. Thank you.

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:26.583
If we put just a little bit
of makeup on you...

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:28.335
Whoa, whoa.

00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:30.837
We're not 13 anymore.

00:10:32.923 --> 00:10:35.842
Ross, this is the only thing left
that has a shot at working.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:38.011
Won't she notice I have makeup on?

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:40.430
Half the guys out there
have makeup on.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.973
What?

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:45.977
Half the people... I mean...
Just try it and see.

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:47.687
No, I am not putting on makeup.

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:53.193
Hello? Ross, could you put up
some of these flyers for me?

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:55.779
No! Demon! Demon!

00:11:02.244 --> 00:11:06.373
Now our drawers will smell nice,
and we didn't waste these pantyhose.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.501
God forbid we throw out old underwear.

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.421
You know what?
I'm gonna go over to Joey's.

00:11:13.631 --> 00:11:15.715
We're supposed to organize
the wrapping paper.

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:20.762
Yes, but I've really gotten in touch
with my feminine side enough today.

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:24.349
In fact, we're two sachets away
from becoming a lesbian couple.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.729
This has been kind of a girlie day.
You're right. I'm sorry.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.482
It's okay. I just feel like I need
to be in a guy place...

00:11:32.733 --> 00:11:34.693
...do kind of a man thing.

00:11:34.902 --> 00:11:37.278
Go over to Joey's and...

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:40.448
...drink some beer and
hammer up some dry wall.

00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:45.036
When guys hang out, they don't just
drink beer and hammer up dry wall.

00:11:45.246 --> 00:11:48.915
When girls hang out, we don't have
pillow fights in our underwear.

00:11:51.210 --> 00:11:53.086
I'm sorry. We do. We do.

00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:54.963
I don't know why I said that.

00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:00.802
Hey, Chandler.

00:12:02.012 --> 00:12:04.347
Come on in.
We're knitting potholders.

00:12:06.308 --> 00:12:08.101
No, thanks, Josephine.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:13.606
Ross, I was wondering if...

00:12:17.945 --> 00:12:21.072
Oh, my God. Where are all the men?

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:34.669
- Oh. Hi, Kim.
- Hi, Rachel.

00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:39.299
Uh, remember that thing that happened
yesterday? Well, it didn't happen.

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.926
You didn't cancel the fabric order
from Taiwan?

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.305
Okay, two things didn't happen.

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:48.475
Remember I told you someone
made out with Ralph Lauren?

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:51.227
Well, it turns out that's not true.

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.480
It's not true?
Oh, that's interesting.

00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:58.234
Because I checked. Only one keycard
was used to access the copy machine...

00:12:58.444 --> 00:13:01.112
...yesterday during lunch,
and that keycard belonged to you, Rachel.

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.532
Oh, no. No, no, no. Oh, God,
you think I made out with him?

00:13:04.742 --> 00:13:08.036
Listen to me, if you think sleeping
with Ralph is gonna get you my job...

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:09.788
...you are sadly mistaken.

00:13:09.955 --> 00:13:12.207
Oh, no. I don't want your job. I don't.

00:13:12.416 --> 00:13:14.751
Oh, this is such a mistake.
I didn't make out with him.

00:13:15.002 --> 00:13:18.880
Nobody made out with him.
I did not use my keycard yesterday.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.591
I don't even know
how to use my keycard.

00:13:23.427 --> 00:13:25.011
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hi, Kim.

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:45.949
Yeah. Nothing happened.

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:49.494
You could cut the sexual tension
in here with a knife.

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:58.670
After that, what could I do
except become a chef?

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:00.588
Mm-hm.

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:03.174
And someday soon,
I hope to open my own restaurant.

00:14:03.467 --> 00:14:04.759
Mm.

00:14:06.303 --> 00:14:08.513
You know, you're a really great listener.

00:14:08.764 --> 00:14:11.224
Most guys I go out with,
they just talk and talk.

00:14:14.562 --> 00:14:16.938
After a while, it's like, "Shut your mouth."
You know?

00:14:19.984 --> 00:14:23.111
I've probably been talking too much.
Why don't we talk about you?

00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:27.448
Come on, I want to know.

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:33.788
Okay. I'm from Long Island.

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:36.666
I came to the city for college.

00:14:36.834 --> 00:14:41.671
Um, I, uh, have a 5-year-old son,
and in my spare time...

00:14:41.922 --> 00:14:46.467
...I like to read spy novels.
But let's talk more about you. Hmm?

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:55.310
So if you sear the stems
of the flowers first in a frying pan...

00:14:55.519 --> 00:14:58.354
...your arrangement will
look fresh much longer.

00:14:59.064 --> 00:15:01.399
Joey, that is such a great tip.

00:15:02.610 --> 00:15:06.237
Monica, can you excuse us?
I need to talk to the girl with the flowers.

00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:10.033
Okay, but, Joey, come over later.

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.035
I'm gonna teach you
how to make a bird feeder...

00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:14.495
...out of just a pine cone
and some peanut butter.

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:16.956
Aw. I love birds.

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:20.835
What is the matter with you?

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.338
- What?
- You're arranging flowers.

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.966
You got dead flowers.

00:15:27.217 --> 00:15:30.136
You've got a picture of a baby
dressed like flowers.

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:33.264
This is not Joey.

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:36.559
Hey, hey, look, I am still Joey, okay?

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:39.687
Flowers, they're just, you know,
nice to look at.

00:15:39.897 --> 00:15:44.442
And that happens to be a picture
by a famous artist of a famous baby.

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:47.362
You're turning into a woman.

00:15:47.947 --> 00:15:49.447
No, I'm not.

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:52.158
Why would you say that?
That's just mean.

00:15:54.536 --> 00:15:56.829
Now I've upset you? What did I say?

00:15:57.373 --> 00:16:00.083
It's not what you said.
It's the way you said it.

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:02.293
Oh, my God.

00:16:02.544 --> 00:16:04.337
I'm a woman.

00:16:11.095 --> 00:16:14.931
So now she thinks that I made out with him
and that I did it to get her job.

00:16:15.182 --> 00:16:17.725
- Why didn't you just tell the truth?
- I did.

00:16:17.935 --> 00:16:23.064
She doesn't think anyone would confuse
Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:27.902
Well, what if Kenny were the real brains
behind the whole company?

00:16:28.112 --> 00:16:31.906
What if Kenny hired that Ralph guy
to be the pretty front man, huh?

00:16:32.157 --> 00:16:33.866
Did she ever think of that?

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:40.039
You were with Kenny today, weren't you?

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:42.041
- Just for a second.
- Ugh.

00:16:43.252 --> 00:16:46.170
- Phoebe, what am I gonna do?
- Well...

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.715
The only thing you can do.
Sleep with Ralph Lauren.

00:16:50.217 --> 00:16:55.346
I'm not gonna sleep with Ralph Lauren.
I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:57.807
Ooh. Sleep with Kenny.

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.939
- That wouldn't help me.
- Oh, yes, it would.

00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:10.278
- I've had a really good time tonight.
- Mm-hm.

00:17:10.529 --> 00:17:14.115
You know, I rarely connect with someone
this much on the first date.

00:17:16.452 --> 00:17:17.869
Me neither.

00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:22.457
Uh, I've had a really
good time too, you know.

00:17:24.626 --> 00:17:26.210
Are you gonna eat that bread?

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:30.173
Oh, I just like the smell.

00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:31.883
Mm.

00:17:33.385 --> 00:17:34.427
You make me laugh.

00:17:36.847 --> 00:17:38.973
Would you like to move over
to the couch?

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:40.808
Mm-hm.

00:17:44.938 --> 00:17:47.523
Maybe I'll just turn down
the lights a little?

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.401
How about all the way?

00:17:50.861 --> 00:17:52.070
Okay.

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.037
Wow, cool poster.

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:04.332
Or should I say, "groovy poster"?

00:18:06.293 --> 00:18:08.419
So, uh...

00:18:09.046 --> 00:18:10.630
...where were we?

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:17.136
Are those your teeth?

00:18:17.346 --> 00:18:18.554
Oh.

00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:22.767
You can see them, huh?

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:25.645
Yes. They're insanely white.

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:28.147
I did that for you.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.110
What's the matter with you?

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:37.115
What's the matter with me?
You've got a black light. It's 1999.

00:18:44.915 --> 00:18:46.833
Oh, good. Kim, hi.

00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:51.838
Hi, Rachel. Oh. I wanted to ask you, have
you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets?

00:18:52.089 --> 00:18:55.258
What am I thinking?
Of course you have.

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:56.968
Okay, look.

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:59.428
I'm sorry that I lied to you before.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.433
You were right. Ralph and I were
an item, but we're not anymore.

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:05.768
Oh, really?

00:19:06.186 --> 00:19:08.396
Yeah, he dumped me.

00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:13.025
He said, "Rachel, I can't do this.

00:19:13.277 --> 00:19:16.445
Even though you're a very, very...

00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:19.031
...very beautiful woman...

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:22.827
...I can't do this.
I'm married and I'm sorry."

00:19:23.078 --> 00:19:26.330
And I don't know why, but he said,
"And you will never get promoted...

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:30.501
...especially not above Kim,
who is an integral cog...

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:32.503
...in the Ralph Lauren machine."

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:36.507
You expect me to believe...

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:40.386
- Hi, Ralph.
- Hi, Kim.

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:00.865
Oh, my God.

00:20:01.116 --> 00:20:06.245
He just gave you the coldest look
I've ever seen. It's like he hates you.

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:08.039
Then it is true.

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:13.878
Of course it's true.
And it hurts so bad.

00:20:14.671 --> 00:20:16.839
Oh, honey, come here.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:18.925
Oh, it'll be okay.

00:20:19.968 --> 00:20:22.637
We've all been there.

00:20:25.641 --> 00:20:27.308
You and Ralph?

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:30.853
Kenny the copy boy.

00:20:42.532 --> 00:20:43.616
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:20:43.825 --> 00:20:48.079
- Uh, I need to talk to you.
- What's the matter? You upset?

00:20:48.288 --> 00:20:50.957
I'm sorry, but we gotta get rid of
all this girlie stuff in here.

00:20:51.124 --> 00:20:52.833
I, uh... I gotta be a man.

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:57.171
Okay? The living room
has to remain a guy place, okay?

00:20:57.422 --> 00:20:59.173
That's just the way it has to be.

00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:02.009
If that's what you want,
I'll just put it all in my room.

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:03.886
Good. Great.

00:21:04.137 --> 00:21:06.597
And, uh, thanks for being
so understanding.

00:21:06.848 --> 00:21:09.517
I didn't want to make
a big deal out of this.

00:21:10.894 --> 00:21:14.272
But you could, uh, put the picture
of the famous baby in my room.

00:21:14.523 --> 00:21:16.315
I mean, if you want to.

00:21:18.568 --> 00:21:19.610
Okay.

00:21:19.861 --> 00:21:22.613
And, uh, maybe the watering can there.

00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:23.906
Sure.

00:21:24.074 --> 00:21:26.575
And a couple of these
little tiny boxes.

00:21:27.911 --> 00:21:31.080
Joey, do you want me
to put it all in your room?

00:21:31.248 --> 00:21:32.248
Okay.
