WEBVTT

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:04.003
Bye-bye.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:06.505
I just got reservations
at Michelle's...

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.966
...and tickets to The Music Man
to celebrate...

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:11.677
...our first holiday
as a betrothed couple.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:15.055
- "Betrothed."
- Betrothed couple.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:17.141
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:00:17.308 --> 00:00:20.185
- Aw.
- Oh.

00:00:23.898 --> 00:00:25.065
- Pheebs?
Uh-huh?

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:26.817
Skull?

00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.318
Oh. Yeah, it's my mom's.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:30.070
Oh, my God!

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.781
No, no, no. It's not my mom.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:34.616
It belonged to my mom.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.287
She used to put it out
every Christmas...

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:42.791
...to remind us that even though
it's Christmas, people still die.

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:46.336
And you can put candy in it.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:50.716
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:00:50.884 --> 00:00:51.925
Licorice?

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.137
Sure. Ha, ha.

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:58.849
- I get Ben for the holidays this year.
- That's great!

00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:01.435
- Are you gonna dress up as Santa?
- Nope.

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:03.437
I know Susan does every year.

00:01:03.605 --> 00:01:06.523
I want to take this year
to teach him about Hanukkah.

00:01:06.691 --> 00:01:08.150
And maybe I could teach Ben...

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:11.153
...about the Christmas skull
and how people die.

00:01:11.654 --> 00:01:14.490
You may need to use this year
to teach Ben about Phoebe.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:15.949
Mm.

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.788
Hey.

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:28.629
- Did you know he was in there?
- No.

00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.883
- How long have we been home?
- About half an hour.

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:34.343
Lovely.

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:18.220
You know what I was thinking?
When we get married, will you, uh...

00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.013
...change your name to "Bing"?

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:22.558
No.

00:02:23.935 --> 00:02:24.977
Why not?

00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:27.729
Bing's weird.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:30.899
Oh, hey, you guys.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.818
Hey.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.236
Guess what?

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.239
My landlord just called.
My apartment's gonna be ready soon.

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:38.782
I guess I'll be moving out.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.659
Aw, Phoebe, I'm gonna miss you.

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.744
Yes, you will be very sad.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.500
- I gotta go tell Rachel the good news.
- Oh. You'll be living together again?

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.378
- Why not?
- She's having so much fun with Joey...

00:02:51.546 --> 00:02:53.881
...I assumed she'd still
be living with him.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:56.717
Why do you think
she's having so much fun?

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.219
No reason, except she...

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.180
...told me.

00:03:01.764 --> 00:03:04.099
She said she didn't want
to live with me?

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:07.019
No. No, she didn't say that.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.355
I think you should talk to Monica now.

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.151
Phoebe, I'm sure
she wants to live with you.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.861
You're absolutely sure?

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.530
No, but I'll bet she probably does.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:19.823
Oh, probably?

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:21.325
I don't like that word.

00:03:23.077 --> 00:03:26.246
I know what "probably" really means.
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.749
"Oh, your mom
probably won't kill herself."

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:32.711
You know. I'm sorry,
but I'm not hanging my hopes...

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:36.340
...of Rachel and I living together
on "probably."

00:03:36.507 --> 00:03:39.134
You gotta take care of yourself
in this world.

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:41.845
History teaches us nothing.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:47.017
Bing doesn't seem so weird now,
does it?

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:53.774
You're home.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.651
Guess what Phoebe got me
for Christmas?

00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.537
- Drums?
- No, drums!

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.171
Could we get
two burritos to go, please? Ha, ha.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:22.219
I'm sorry. But not that sorry,
you don't have to live with it.

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:24.888
Um, we have a reservation under Bing.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:28.475
Okay, we'll have a table for you
in about 45 minutes.

00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:31.645
We have tickets
to The Music Man at 8.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:34.648
I'm sorry.
Christmas is a very busy time, sir.

00:04:34.857 --> 00:04:37.109
Is this because of the burrito thing?

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:42.948
- You need to give him money.
- It was a joke!

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:46.785
To get a table. Places like this
are always shaking you down.

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:50.455
- Everybody wants a payoff.
- All right, calm down, O'Malley.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.711
- I'll slip him some money.
- But you've got to be smooth.

00:04:55.878 --> 00:04:58.130
Hey, I can be smooth.

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:05.387
We're in a hurry.
If you could get us a table...

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.306
...a bit quicker, I'd appreciate it.

00:05:07.473 --> 00:05:09.725
- Of course, sir.
- Okay.

00:05:11.686 --> 00:05:14.646
- How'd it go?
- Had the money in the wrong hand.

00:05:21.946 --> 00:05:22.988
You don't feel...

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:24.823
...like you're gonna throw up?
- No.

00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.617
Well, I do. So let's...

00:05:28.369 --> 00:05:31.330
So, Ben, you, uh...

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.999
You know what holiday is coming up?

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:35.208
Christmas.

00:05:35.376 --> 00:05:38.587
Yeah, and you know what
other holiday is coming up?

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.130
Christmas Eve.

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.092
Yes, but also...

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:47.054
Hanukkah!

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:52.059
See, you're part Jewish
and Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday.

00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:54.936
Santa has reindeers that can fly.

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:56.563
Right, um, but on Hanukkah...

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.191
Hanukkah is a celebration
of a miracle.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:03.070
Years and years ago there were
these people called the Maccabees.

00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:04.654
Jingle bells, jingle bells

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:06.615
Okay, that's right. Yes...

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:09.534
...but on Hanukkah, we sing, uh:

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:12.579
Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel
I made you out of clay

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.415
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

00:06:15.583 --> 00:06:18.251
Ha, ha. Okay, it's not a contest.

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:20.128
When is Santa coming?

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:24.883
How about this year,
instead of Santa...

00:06:25.093 --> 00:06:27.803
...we have fun celebrating Hanukkah?

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.888
No Santa?

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.681
Was I bad?

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.936
No, no, no, you weren't bad.
You've been very good, Ben.

00:06:36.104 --> 00:06:39.481
- Santa's mad at me.
- No, hey, hey, come on.

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.067
Ben, Santa is not mad at you, okay?

00:06:42.276 --> 00:06:44.444
You're his favorite little guy.

00:06:44.612 --> 00:06:46.113
So Santa's coming?

00:06:48.324 --> 00:06:49.908
Yes!

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:51.785
Santa's coming.

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:58.875
It's easy. Just keep it casual.

00:06:59.043 --> 00:07:02.587
Shake his hand and give him the money.

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:05.882
- How do you know so much about this?
- I don't know.

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.718
Richard used to do it, didn't he?

00:07:09.345 --> 00:07:11.930
We'd be eating our soup right now.

00:07:12.473 --> 00:07:15.392
Mustached bastard.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:20.313
Those people just left. Come on.
Quick, give him the money.

00:07:20.898 --> 00:07:21.940
Excuse me.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:31.408
We're in a bit of a hurry.
Can we please?

00:07:31.576 --> 00:07:33.410
Ah-ha-ha-ha.

00:07:47.508 --> 00:07:48.633
Ha!

00:07:50.094 --> 00:07:52.179
So you like the drums.

00:07:52.388 --> 00:07:54.306
That's great.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.185
I was worried that
they would create maybe...

00:07:58.352 --> 00:08:00.687
...an unbearable living situation.

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:04.941
But, okay, well, apparently not.
So, yay!

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:07.360
Hey, we already learned a song.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:10.864
Ready? One, two, three, four.

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.534
Tequila!

00:08:16.871 --> 00:08:18.622
That's fun.

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:26.505
Here you go.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:29.132
Thank you, Gunther.
Put her there.

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:34.429
Definitely not easier with coins.

00:08:35.515 --> 00:08:37.098
Thank you.

00:08:39.769 --> 00:08:41.061
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:44.481
Here. Now I only owe you $49.50.

00:08:45.775 --> 00:08:47.108
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Hey.

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:51.112
If you want to get Joey a gift
that disrupts the entire building...

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:53.406
...why not something more subtle...

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:54.866
...like a wrecking ball...

00:08:55.034 --> 00:08:58.578
...or a vial of smallpox
to release in the hallway?

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.706
It's not just the drum noise.
Every five minutes...

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:03.750
...Joey throws his sticks
in the air...

00:09:03.918 --> 00:09:07.379
...and I have to hear:
"Oh, my eye! Oh, God, my eye!"

00:09:07.588 --> 00:09:10.173
- I mean, it's so annoying.
- Yes, thank you.

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:14.970
You see, this is how normal people
are supposed to react to drums.

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:19.015
You got Joey drums to annoy Rachel...

00:09:19.183 --> 00:09:21.643
...so she wouldn't want
to live there anymore?

00:09:22.103 --> 00:09:23.937
Maybe on some level.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.657
You could just not throw the sticks
up in the air.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:37.867
What is rock 'n' roll about that?

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:42.914
Hey, Joey, I got you another present.

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.668
Hold it!
Before you tell me what it is...

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:51.798
Okay, what is it?

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.133
It's a...

00:09:53.342 --> 00:09:54.593
...tarantula!

00:09:57.638 --> 00:09:59.014
Oh.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:03.977
God, Rachel, I'm sorry.
What was I thinking...

00:10:04.145 --> 00:10:07.314
...giving Joey this big, gross,
scary spider...

00:10:07.523 --> 00:10:11.234
...in such a poorly constructed cage?

00:10:11.736 --> 00:10:14.487
What are you talking about?
I love them.

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:20.535
I had a tarantula when I was a kid.
But it died because my cat ate it.

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:23.371
And then my cat died.

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:25.665
But, Joey, isn't this cool?

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:28.585
Is it on me?
I feel like it's on me. I got...

00:10:31.464 --> 00:10:33.089
Oh, isn't that adorable?

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:36.551
- Joey is afraid of the tarantula.
- Oh.

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.011
He's so adorable.

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:39.554
He's so much fun.

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:42.390
I'm glad you're having
so much fun here.

00:10:42.558 --> 00:10:44.059
Whoa. Wait a minute.

00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:45.268
What's the matter?

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:47.604
Our apartment is ready.

00:10:48.272 --> 00:10:52.359
And that makes you angry because?

00:10:52.526 --> 00:10:55.153
Because you'd rather
live here with Joey.

00:10:55.321 --> 00:10:58.031
- Where did you get that?
- Monica and Chandler...

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.575
...said you were having
so much fun here...

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:05.497
...and apparently no amount of drums
or tarantulas is gonna change that.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:09.751
Did you get all this stuff for Joey...

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:12.253
...to try to drive me out
of the apartment?

00:11:13.964 --> 00:11:15.924
You might as well
have gotten him a fish.

00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.385
You know how fish freak me out.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.221
Fish.

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:25.350
But it wouldn't have mattered.
We're gonna live together.

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:27.435
That's the deal.

00:11:27.603 --> 00:11:29.896
Yes, but I wanted you to want
to live with me.

00:11:30.106 --> 00:11:32.857
But if you're having
so much fun over here...

00:11:33.025 --> 00:11:35.193
Oh. It's so much more fun with you.

00:11:35.361 --> 00:11:38.154
- We did have fun, didn't we?
- We did.

00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:41.491
They say if we want,
we could see it tonight.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.785
- I would love to.
- Yay, okay!

00:11:43.953 --> 00:11:46.955
- Good, good, good.
- Great. All right. Good.

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:49.916
And Monica asked me
to make the drumming stop.

00:11:50.918 --> 00:11:53.712
Um, ahem.

00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:56.673
Done.

00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:03.763
Hey.

00:12:03.931 --> 00:12:06.266
Hello, sir.
You here to return those pants?

00:12:12.606 --> 00:12:14.816
No, these are my pants.

00:12:15.234 --> 00:12:16.443
Oh.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.153
Okay.

00:12:18.654 --> 00:12:22.407
- How can I help you?
- Um, do you have a Santa outfit left?

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:24.784
Two days before Christmas?
Sorry, man.

00:12:25.119 --> 00:12:28.955
Okay, look.
Do you have anything, uh, Christmas-y?

00:12:29.123 --> 00:12:32.000
I promised my son, and I really
don't want to disappoint him.

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:36.337
Um, come on,
you gotta have something.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.507
I'm the Holiday Armadillo!

00:12:41.761 --> 00:12:43.636
I'm a friend of Santa's...

00:12:43.804 --> 00:12:46.639
...and he sent me here to wish you...

00:12:46.807 --> 00:12:50.059
...a merry Christmas!

00:12:50.811 --> 00:12:54.397
What happened to Santa,
Holiday Armadillo?

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:57.984
Santa was unavailable...

00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:01.112
...so close to Christmas.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:03.656
Come in, have a seat.

00:13:03.824 --> 00:13:07.786
You must be exhausted,
coming all the way from Texas.

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:13.208
- Texas?
- That's right, Ben.

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:15.168
I'm Santa's representative...

00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:19.255
...for all the Southern states.

00:13:19.423 --> 00:13:22.759
And Mexico!

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:25.720
But Santa sent me here...

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.557
...to give you these presents, Ben.

00:13:29.767 --> 00:13:33.269
Maybe the lady will help me
with these presents.

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:49.702
Wow, thanks!

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:51.329
You're welcome, Ben.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:54.415
Merry Christmas. Ooh.

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:58.211
And happy Hanukkah!

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:02.674
Are you for Hanukkah too?
Because I'm part Jewish.

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:06.177
You are? Me too.

00:14:06.887 --> 00:14:10.974
Because armadillos
also wandered in the desert?

00:14:12.893 --> 00:14:15.228
You want to wander in the hall?

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:19.107
Oh. Hey, Ben!

00:14:19.275 --> 00:14:21.484
What if the Holiday Armadillo...

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:25.280
...told you all about
the Festival of Lights?

00:14:25.447 --> 00:14:26.531
Cool!

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.283
Come on, Ben.

00:14:31.495 --> 00:14:33.955
Years and years ago...

00:14:34.164 --> 00:14:36.416
...there were these people called...

00:14:36.625 --> 00:14:38.084
...the Maccabees!

00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:41.796
Ho-ho-ho. Merry Christmas!

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:44.632
Santa!

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.217
Hey.

00:14:47.177 --> 00:14:50.054
What are you doing here, Santa?

00:14:52.141 --> 00:14:54.809
Well, I'm here to see
my old buddy, Ben.

00:14:55.477 --> 00:14:57.186
What are you doing here...

00:14:57.396 --> 00:15:01.190
...Weird Turtle Man?

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:05.945
I'm the Holiday Armadillo...

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:09.532
...your part-Jewish friend.

00:15:10.993 --> 00:15:14.787
You sent me here
to give Ben some presents.

00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:16.873
Remember?

00:15:18.208 --> 00:15:19.250
What?

00:15:22.296 --> 00:15:24.464
Did you bring me any presents, Santa?

00:15:24.632 --> 00:15:26.341
You bet I did, Ben.

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:28.551
Put her there.

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:37.936
Well, it would have worked this time
if his hands weren't so damn small.

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:43.274
Ho-ho-ho.

00:15:43.484 --> 00:15:45.109
Ben, come open more presents.

00:15:45.277 --> 00:15:48.196
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

00:15:48.822 --> 00:15:51.491
There's a sentence
I never thought I'd say.

00:15:53.327 --> 00:15:54.702
What are you doing?

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:58.122
You said you were having trouble
finding a Santa costume...

00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.792
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

00:16:01.043 --> 00:16:03.586
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

00:16:03.754 --> 00:16:05.254
- Why?
- Because...

00:16:05.422 --> 00:16:08.132
...I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah...

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:09.842
...and you're wrecking it.

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:14.138
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowlful of jelly.

00:16:17.226 --> 00:16:21.104
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

00:16:22.022 --> 00:16:25.358
Fine, I'll give the suit back.

00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:29.529
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

00:16:31.865 --> 00:16:33.741
Santa, really?

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:35.743
Yeah, is that okay?

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.580
Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

00:16:40.791 --> 00:16:44.127
- No.
- Then it's okay!

00:16:45.295 --> 00:16:47.588
Okay, Ben. Santa has to go.

00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:49.340
Say goodbye.

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:52.176
No, why does he have to go?

00:16:52.344 --> 00:16:56.639
Because if Santa and the Holiday...

00:16:57.016 --> 00:16:58.808
...Armadillo...

00:17:00.894 --> 00:17:03.312
...are ever in the same room
for too long...

00:17:03.522 --> 00:17:06.649
...the universe will implode!

00:17:08.235 --> 00:17:10.611
Merry Christmas!

00:17:12.031 --> 00:17:15.908
No, why can't the armadillo leave?
I want Santa.

00:17:18.245 --> 00:17:19.996
Fine, I give up. Santa...

00:17:20.205 --> 00:17:22.749
Santa can stay!

00:17:24.668 --> 00:17:25.710
Well, I'll stay...

00:17:25.919 --> 00:17:29.464
...but only because I want to hear
about Hanukkah.

00:17:30.299 --> 00:17:32.800
Ben, will you sit here with Santa...

00:17:32.968 --> 00:17:35.219
...and learn about Hanukkah?

00:17:35.387 --> 00:17:37.513
Okay, Santa.

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:40.058
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:17:40.267 --> 00:17:42.351
All right, it's time...

00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:45.855
...for the story of Hanukkah.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.149
Years and years ago...

00:17:48.317 --> 00:17:52.195
...there were these people
called the Maccabees!

00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:54.864
Merry Christmas!

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:08.169
Oh, wow, look at this place!

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:12.548
Oh, this is terrible.

00:18:12.716 --> 00:18:14.217
They've made so many changes...

00:18:14.384 --> 00:18:17.762
...I can't even feel
my grandmother's presence anymore.

00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:20.473
Oh, new sconces!

00:18:21.433 --> 00:18:23.184
- Oh, my God!
- What?

00:18:23.852 --> 00:18:27.480
Remember, uh, how you told me
your grandmother put up that wall...

00:18:27.689 --> 00:18:29.941
...to make that into two bedrooms?
- Yeah.

00:18:30.109 --> 00:18:32.401
And that the landlord
might find out...

00:18:32.611 --> 00:18:34.737
...and then tear it down?
- Yeah?

00:18:35.572 --> 00:18:38.032
Do you really not know
where I'm going?

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:40.827
It left. It's one huge room.

00:18:41.036 --> 00:18:43.079
Oh, no!

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:47.041
Wow!

00:18:48.335 --> 00:18:49.544
See?

00:18:49.711 --> 00:18:52.421
I guess we'll have to
put the wall back up.

00:18:52.589 --> 00:18:56.634
- You can't because of the new skylight.
- There's a skylight?

00:18:57.386 --> 00:18:58.761
Wow!

00:18:59.513 --> 00:19:03.099
Oh. So should we start looking
for a new place?

00:19:06.436 --> 00:19:07.937
You know, I'm sensing...

00:19:08.105 --> 00:19:12.191
...that, um, my grandmother
would not be comfortable with that.

00:19:13.694 --> 00:19:14.902
Oh, yeah?

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:18.072
Starting to feel her again there,
are we?

00:19:18.699 --> 00:19:20.992
- A little bit. Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:19:22.119 --> 00:19:25.872
Is your grandmother maybe saying
that you should live here alone?

00:19:26.039 --> 00:19:28.291
You heard it too? You have the gift.

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:31.878
Phoebe, it's okay.

00:19:32.045 --> 00:19:34.255
I like living with Joey.

00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:36.883
- Are you sure?
- Please. I hate packing...

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:38.593
...it's closer to work.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.053
And we do have fun.

00:19:41.722 --> 00:19:45.433
Although, I'm really gonna miss
living with you.

00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:47.935
- Oh, me too.
- I know.

00:19:49.813 --> 00:19:51.689
Oh. Did you hear that?

00:19:51.857 --> 00:19:54.066
I'm getting something
from your grandmother.

00:19:54.234 --> 00:19:57.570
She said since you get to keep
the one-bedroom apartment...

00:19:57.738 --> 00:20:01.282
...you should give Rachel
the purple chair.

00:20:03.577 --> 00:20:05.953
No, I do not hear that.

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:10.625
And the miracle was that
that little bit of oil...

00:20:10.792 --> 00:20:14.670
...that should have lasted
just one day, burned for...

00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:16.797
- Eight whole days.
- That's right.

00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:20.843
And that's why we celebrate
Hanukkah today. The end.

00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:23.054
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:24.472
My favorite part...

00:20:24.681 --> 00:20:29.268
...was when Superman
flew all the Jews out of Egypt.

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:37.944
The armadillo was actually
not so thrilled about that part.

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:41.072
Okay, Ben, it's time to light...

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:44.408
...the Hanukkah candles!

00:20:44.576 --> 00:20:46.202
Ho-ho-ho.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:54.252
Hey.

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:55.795
- Oh.
- Wow.

00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:58.422
Looks like the Easter Bunny's
funeral in here.

00:21:01.551 --> 00:21:03.886
Come on, come on.
We're lighting the candles.

00:21:04.054 --> 00:21:05.638
Oh, oh.

00:21:09.184 --> 00:21:10.935
I understand why Superman is here...

00:21:11.103 --> 00:21:14.939
...but why is there a porcupine
at the Easter Bunny's funeral?

00:21:23.156 --> 00:21:25.658
- You get it?
- I got it.

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.702
Back in the cage?

00:21:28.787 --> 00:21:30.913
It's back in the cage.

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:32.957
Is the cage closed?

00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:37.920
Joey, will you just come out here
and stop being such a baby?
