WEBVTT

00:00:02.752 --> 00:00:04.378
Oh. Mm.

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:05.629
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:08.173
You have got to try this cheesecake.

00:00:08.341 --> 00:00:10.426
Oh, you know,
I'm not that much of a sweet tooth...

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:14.638
- Oh, my God, it's so creamy.
- Oh.

00:00:15.598 --> 00:00:18.350
Oh, my God. That's the best
cheesecake I've ever had.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.893
Where did you get this?

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:24.523
It was at the front door when I got home.
Somebody sent it to us.

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.818
Chandler, this isn't addressed to you.

00:00:27.986 --> 00:00:30.070
This is addressed
to Mrs. Braverman downstairs.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:32.448
Thief.

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:36.493
I didn't read the box before I opened it...

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:38.704
...and you can't return a box
after you opened it.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:41.957
- Why not?
- Because it's too delicious.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:46.336
Chandler, you stole this cheesecake.
That is wrong.

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:48.297
No, no, no, it is going to be okay...

00:00:48.465 --> 00:00:51.258
...because Mrs. Braverman
is gonna send away for a free one.

00:00:51.426 --> 00:00:53.052
And that way, we all win.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.431
The only losers are the
big cheesecake conglomerate:

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:00.017
"Mama's Little Bakery."

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:02.728
I feel terrible.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.230
I'm a horrible, horrible, horrible person.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.442
Well, I'm sorry, what?

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:51.860
I should get going. Big day at work.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:54.196
You know how I'm in a coma?

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:58.325
Today they do a test on me and it
turns out I'm not brain-dead.

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:00.452
So...

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.204
Ah-ah, Mr. Smarty-Pants.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:04.832
It's just my character
that's not brain-dead.

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:07.835
Pheebs, still on for tonight?

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:10.629
- Absolutely. Okay.
- All right, I'll see you at 8.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.172
Oh, what's at 8?

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.924
Oh, I have dinner plans with Joey.

00:02:14.092 --> 00:02:17.177
We get together about once
a month to discuss the rest of you guys.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:20.764
Wow. Did not know that.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:23.475
May I say how lovely you look today?

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:25.227
Duly noted.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.563
Oh, so for tomorrow...

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.190
...do you want to rent a car
and drive down together or what?

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:31.859
What are you talking about?

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.027
Cousin Frannie's wedding.
It's tomorrow night.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.489
You were invited?

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.534
No.

00:02:40.702 --> 00:02:42.786
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

00:02:42.954 --> 00:02:45.289
I knew Mom and Dad were invited.
I thought that was it.

00:02:45.456 --> 00:02:49.710
I mean, from the ages of 7 to 9,
Frannie and I were inseparable.

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:53.714
Well, maybe since the age of 9,
Frannie's made some new friends.

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.760
Look, it's probably just a mistake.
Let me call Aunt Cheryl, okay?

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:02.097
Maybe you are invited and the invitation
just got lost in the mail.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:05.475
Yeah, well, you call her and tell her
that, you know, when we were kids...

00:03:05.643 --> 00:03:09.021
...her precious little Frannie
tried to undress me several times, okay?

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.566
If I hadn't stopped her, there probably
wouldn't be a wedding to go to.

00:03:13.234 --> 00:03:15.861
She tried to undress me too.

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.072
I used to undress my cousin Glenn.

00:03:26.247 --> 00:03:30.375
Joseph Francis Tribbiani,
are you home yet?

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:32.586
Um, I think he's still out.
What's wrong?

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:34.379
Well, I'll tell you, Rachel Karen Green.

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:38.342
I had plans with Joey tonight,
and he left me this note.

00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:42.262
"Pheebs, can't make it.
Got a date. Talk to you later.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.139
Big Daddy."

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:48.060
- "Big Daddy"?
- Oh, that's a nickname we were trying out.

00:03:48.228 --> 00:03:52.522
Hey, you know what nickname
never caught on? "The Ross-a-tron."

00:03:55.401 --> 00:03:58.195
- Hey.
- Oh, here's Joseph Francis.

00:03:58.363 --> 00:04:01.907
Whoa, what are you
middle-naming me for?

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.408
I left you a note.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:05.953
So what? That doesn't give you
the right to ditch me.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.332
Hey, you can cancel plans with friends
if there's a possibility for sex.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.292
Phoebe, he's right. That is the rule.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:13.752
I don't accept this rule.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.338
When we make plans,
I expect you to show up.

00:04:16.506 --> 00:04:19.758
Okay, I can't just be a way to kill time
till you meet someone better.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:24.638
You know, boyfriends and girlfriends
are gonna come and go, but this is for life.

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:28.976
Wow. I'm so sorry. I had no idea
it would bother you this much.

00:04:29.143 --> 00:04:30.519
Well, it does.

00:04:30.687 --> 00:04:33.230
Okay, can I make it up to you? Huh?

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.648
I'm sorry.

00:04:34.816 --> 00:04:38.443
How about dinner tomorrow night?
I'll pay for myself.

00:04:40.947 --> 00:04:42.948
Okay, you wore me down.

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.787
Joe, while you're over there, how about
another beer for "The Ross-a-tron"?

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.957
"Ross..." Is that back?

00:04:57.297 --> 00:04:59.715
- Hi.
- The other cheesecake came.

00:04:59.882 --> 00:05:02.134
They delivered it
to the wrong address again.

00:05:03.136 --> 00:05:05.971
So just bring it back downstairs.
What's the problem?

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:08.598
I can't seem to say goodbye.

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:12.019
Are you serious? Chandler,
we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago...

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:13.228
...and you want more?

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:16.106
Well, I've forgotten
what it tastes like, okay?

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:19.234
It was cheesecake. It was fine.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:23.530
It had a buttery, crumbly,
graham-cracker crust...

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.074
...with a very rich...

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:30.370
...yet light cream-cheese filling.

00:05:32.665 --> 00:05:35.876
Wow, my whole mouth
just filled with saliva. Ahem.

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:39.129
Know what? Forget it.
We are just hungry.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:41.840
We have not had lunch.
We are just lightheaded.

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:45.594
So let us go out and have lunch
and forget about the cheesecake.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:47.888
We'll drop it off downstairs
so we're not tempted.

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:49.473
Where do you wanna go to lunch?

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.308
Mama's Little Bakery, Chicago, Illinois.

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:56.646
Aw.

00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:59.191
Mel Tormé died.

00:05:59.359 --> 00:06:01.818
Joey, that paper's like a year old.

00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:05.447
Oh, does that mean
the Sam Goody's sale is over?

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:08.575
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:11.745
So I finally heard back
from Aunt Cheryl...

00:06:11.913 --> 00:06:14.331
...and apparently it wasn't a mistake.

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:16.541
Uh, there's limited seating in the hall...

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:21.588
Limited seating?
I am just one tiny person.

00:06:22.256 --> 00:06:24.383
Yeah, but she doesn't know that.

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.219
I mean, the last time she saw you...

00:06:27.387 --> 00:06:31.264
...you would've turned one of those
little wedding chairs into kindling.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:36.478
"Limited seating."
That's such a lame excuse.

00:06:36.646 --> 00:06:38.730
That's not the reason
why she's not inviting me.

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:42.984
What's the big deal? I wasn't even invited
to the ceremony, just the reception.

00:06:43.152 --> 00:06:45.195
And you know what?
If it makes you feel any better...

00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:47.322
...Joan and I will just
make an appearance...

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.826
...and then we'll leave early
as a sign of protest.

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.578
- Joan?
- Yeah, Joan Tedeschi, my date.

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:56.289
She's an assistant professor
in the Linguistics Department.

00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:57.791
Tall, very beautiful.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:02.337
And despite what some people say,
not broad-backed.

00:07:03.297 --> 00:07:06.675
Wait a minute.
You got "Ross Geller and guest"?

00:07:06.843 --> 00:07:08.969
I wasn't invited,
and you got "and guest"?

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:12.806
Uh, excuse me, I do have to interrupt
on Ross' behalf.

00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:14.850
I think the rule applies here.

00:07:15.017 --> 00:07:16.977
Since he has a chance
to get on broad-back...

00:07:17.145 --> 00:07:18.395
Not broad-back!

00:07:19.981 --> 00:07:22.524
Wait a minute. You're bringing me.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:24.359
What? I can't cancel on Joan.

00:07:24.527 --> 00:07:26.778
- Why not?
- Did you not hear me?

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:30.615
She's an assistant professor
in the Linguistics Department, okay?

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:32.701
They're wild.

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:36.788
- Why do you want to come anyway?
- Because...

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:38.665
...she's my cousin.

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:41.835
I mean, we grew up together.

00:07:42.003 --> 00:07:45.547
Family, you know?
And all that's important to me.

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:49.342
Okay, all right. I'll take you.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.719
I'll go call Joan.

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:53.680
Oh, that's nice.

00:07:53.848 --> 00:07:55.682
Family should be there.

00:07:56.058 --> 00:07:58.101
This is her wedding.
Happiest day of her life.

00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:59.895
We'll see. Ha, ha.

00:08:04.901 --> 00:08:06.902
Well, thank you for lunch.

00:08:07.069 --> 00:08:09.070
Wait a minute, I didn't pay.
I thought you paid.

00:08:09.238 --> 00:08:11.907
So apparently,
we just don't pay for food anymore.

00:08:14.911 --> 00:08:17.829
- Do you see what I see?
- Huh! It's still there.

00:08:18.789 --> 00:08:21.082
Mrs. Braverman must be out.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.797
She could be out of town.
Maybe she'll be gone for months.

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:29.841
By then, the cheesecake
may have gone bad.

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.927
We don't want her to come back
to bad cheesecake.

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:33.762
- That could kill her.
- Wouldn't want that.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:35.013
No, we're protecting her.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.681
- We should take it.
- But move quick.

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.767
- Why?
- I heard her moving around in there.

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:40.310
Go, go, go.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.234
Oh, my God, that's David.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.402
- Who?
- David, the scientist guy.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.071
David that I was in love with.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:54.324
David who went to Russia
and broke my heart, David.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:55.700
Oh, my God.

00:08:55.868 --> 00:08:58.078
Oh, you say someone's name enough,
they turn around.

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.708
- Phoebe.
- David.

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:09.464
What are you doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in Russia?

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:12.008
Yeah, I'm just in town for a conference.

00:09:12.176 --> 00:09:15.303
Um, God, you look phenomenal.

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:16.972
Well, ha, ha...

00:09:17.139 --> 00:09:18.473
Yeah.

00:09:19.016 --> 00:09:22.018
You look great too.
Did you get a haircut?

00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:24.771
Yeah. Well, I got like 30 of them.

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:26.273
Yeah.

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.692
- Um, look, I got a confession to make.
- Uh-huh.

00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:31.236
Um, I was hoping to run into you here.

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:34.948
I didn't know that I should call or not.
You know, I was only in town a few days...

00:09:35.116 --> 00:09:37.867
...and, you know, I didn't want
to intrude on your life or anything.

00:09:38.035 --> 00:09:40.036
But I really wanted to see you...

00:09:40.204 --> 00:09:43.081
...but I didn't know
if you wanted to see me.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:48.920
Of course I would want to see you.
I think about you all the time.

00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:51.339
Really?
Because I think about you all the time.

00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:53.675
- Really?
- There's a statue in Minsk...

00:09:53.843 --> 00:09:55.885
...that reminds me of you so much.

00:09:56.053 --> 00:09:58.346
I mean, um, it's actually of Lenin...

00:09:59.348 --> 00:10:02.142
- ...but, you know, at certain angles...
- Yeah.

00:10:03.144 --> 00:10:05.312
Anyway, do you want
to have dinner tonight?

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:07.063
Yes.

00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:09.858
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:11.318
- Uh, what?
- I can't.

00:10:11.485 --> 00:10:14.779
I can't believe I have plans. I can't.
Can you do it tomorrow?

00:10:14.947 --> 00:10:19.367
Uh, no, I have to go in a few hours.
I have to be on the redeye.

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:22.662
Well, listen, you know,
next time you're in Minsk, uh...

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.583
- Phoebe? Can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh-huh.

00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:27.792
What are you doing?

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.630
- Well, I have plans with Joey tonight.
- So? He'll understand.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:34.132
No, he won't.
And that's not even the point.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:39.596
Monica, I made a whole speech about
how you do not cancel plans with friends.

00:10:40.264 --> 00:10:44.059
And now, you know, what? Just because,
potentially, the love of my life...

00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:49.105
...comes back from Russia just for
one night, I should change my beliefs?

00:10:49.273 --> 00:10:51.274
I should change my beliefs.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:56.488
No. No, no. If I don't have my principles,
I don't have anything.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:57.989
God, you are so strong.

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:02.035
Or I should rush through dinner
with Joey and I could meet David at 9.

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:11.503
Oh, my God, that is so good.

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:15.256
I'm full. And yet I know
if I stop eating this...

00:11:15.424 --> 00:11:17.258
...I'll regret it.

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:20.804
Hey, what have you got there?

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.597
Oh, it's, um...

00:11:22.765 --> 00:11:25.558
- It's tofu cake. Do you want some?
- Aah.

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.064
- What are you doing tonight?
- Huh?

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.525
- Uh.
- Dude. Dude.

00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:38.071
Sorry. Uh, I got those plans with Phoebe.
Why?

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:41.157
Oh, really? Uh, Monica said
she had a date at 9.

00:11:41.325 --> 00:11:44.035
- What? Tonight?
- That's what Monica said.

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:45.912
After she gave me that big speech...

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.165
...she goes and makes a date on
the same night she has plans with me?

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:51.835
I think she's trying to pull a fast one
on Big Daddy.

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:01.469
Here, I think this is us. Yeah.

00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:04.139
Limited seating, my ass.

00:12:04.306 --> 00:12:06.683
Let's just see who made the cut.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:09.602
Hi. Hi. I'm Monica Geller.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:12.272
- How do you know the bride and groom?
- I worked with Frannie.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.983
Used to work with her. Used to.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.402
I'm a relative and I didn't get invited,
okay?

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.946
A blood relative. Blood.

00:12:21.699 --> 00:12:24.492
Stop saying "blood" to strangers.

00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:28.246
So how about you?
How do you know the happy couple?

00:12:28.414 --> 00:12:31.291
We went to college with both of them.
And now we live next door.

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.127
Okay, you're fine.

00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:41.134
- Hey. Are you guys ready?
- Hey. Yes.

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:45.138
I will have a green salad, um,
house dressing and water's fine.

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:47.390
- Okay.
- And for you, sir?

00:12:47.558 --> 00:12:50.393
Yeah. This slow-roasted salmon...

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:51.978
...just how slow are we talking?

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:55.273
It's already been roasted.

00:12:55.441 --> 00:12:59.319
Oh, then no. Maybe I should hear
those specials again.

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:02.322
Oh, Joey, we've heard
the specials three times, okay?

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:06.409
There's prime rib, mahi-mahi
and a very special lobster ravioli.

00:13:06.577 --> 00:13:11.331
- Actually, we're out of the lobster ravioli.
- Oh, well, that changes everything.

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:14.584
- You know what, Pheebs?
- Uh-huh.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:17.962
You were right before.
Friends are so important.

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:20.632
Yeah, I'm very wise. I know.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:22.342
You know what I really want?

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:25.720
- What?
- Is to have a long, long talk.

00:13:25.888 --> 00:13:29.891
You know? Get Joey out on the
open road and really open him up.

00:13:31.018 --> 00:13:32.602
- Any progress?
- Yes.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:35.605
I will have the lobster ravioli.

00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:38.900
God, Joey, this is taking forever.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.735
- What's the rush?
- Well...

00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:43.655
...I just have, you know, an appointment.

00:13:43.864 --> 00:13:45.740
And it's very important.

00:13:45.908 --> 00:13:47.075
What is it?

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:49.786
Well...

00:13:49.954 --> 00:13:50.995
...it's a date.

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:54.874
A date? No, no, Pheebs,
you must be mistaken...

00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:56.751
...because you wouldn't
schedule a date...

00:13:56.919 --> 00:13:58.670
...on the night you have plans
with a friend.

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:00.713
Come on.
Don't make me feel badly about this.

00:14:00.881 --> 00:14:02.423
No, I'm gonna.

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:06.261
That's right.
Yeah, you made me feel really guilty...

00:14:06.428 --> 00:14:07.762
...about going out with that girl.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.724
Like I did something terrible to you.
Now, Pheebs, you're doing the same thing.

00:14:11.892 --> 00:14:14.602
That's not the same thing.
This is totally different.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:17.856
This is with David.
Remember David, the scientist guy?

00:14:18.023 --> 00:14:19.566
Okay, he's very special to me.

00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:21.901
Okay, well, my girl
from the other night was special.

00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:23.319
She was a scientist too.

00:14:23.737 --> 00:14:26.364
- She was?
- Well, she graduated high school.

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.908
Okay, whatever. Know what?

00:14:29.076 --> 00:14:30.410
I don't have time to convince you.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.787
He's only here for four hours
and I'm gonna go see him.

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:35.748
- Fine. Fine!
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:40.753
What are you still doing here?
I told you, lobster ravioli.

00:14:43.465 --> 00:14:44.465
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:47.594
Oh, I was just about to leave.
I didn't think you were coming.

00:14:47.761 --> 00:14:50.263
Oh, I wouldn't have missed this. Ha, ha.

00:14:50.431 --> 00:14:52.390
Well, I'm very glad you're here.

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:55.226
Oh, you're such a gentleman.

00:14:55.394 --> 00:14:57.520
Come on, we're going to my place.

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:06.654
Are you eating the cheesecake
without me?

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:08.489
Mm-mm.

00:15:09.825 --> 00:15:12.952
I will give you $100 to whistle right now.

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:19.584
How can you eat the cheesecake
without me?

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:20.793
What are you gonna do?

00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:24.714
Gonna run and tell Monica or Joey?
No, you'd have to tell them what we did.

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:28.635
We are dessert stealers.
We are living outside the law.

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:31.304
You know what?
I don't trust you with this cake.

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:34.098
- And I got it first, and I'm taking it back.
- What?

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:37.352
- What? Oh, no, you don't.
- Oh, yes.

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:39.854
You think I trust you with it?

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:41.981
We're gonna split it.
You take half, I take half.

00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:43.650
That's not fair. You had some.

00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:46.778
Oh, you know what? I think Monica
would be very interested to know...

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.864
...that you called her cheesecake
dry and mealy.

00:15:50.032 --> 00:15:52.659
- What do we use to split it?
- Okay.

00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:57.747
- All right, pick a half.
- Okay.

00:15:57.915 --> 00:16:01.042
- Well, this side looks bigger.
- Mm-hm.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.963
Uh, but there's more crust on this side.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.382
Yeah. So maybe if I measure it...

00:16:07.549 --> 00:16:08.841
For God's sake, pick a piece.

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:13.012
- All right, I pick that one.
- So the smaller piece.

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:15.598
Okay. There you go.

00:16:15.766 --> 00:16:18.935
Enjoy your half, my friend. But that is it.

00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:22.730
No sharing, no switching,
and don't come crying to me...

00:16:22.898 --> 00:16:24.774
...if you eat your piece too fast.

00:16:32.324 --> 00:16:33.908
Oh!

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.038
- You gonna give me some of your piece?
- Oh, no.

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:42.750
No switching, no sharing.
And don't come crying to me.

00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:46.838
Ha, ha. I may just sit here
and have my cake all day.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:50.216
Just sit here in the hallway
and eat my...

00:16:58.892 --> 00:17:02.145
Never met a girl that could me feel...

00:17:02.312 --> 00:17:04.188
Ross, sweetheart.

00:17:04.356 --> 00:17:06.065
Oh, hey, Aunt Millie.

00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:10.319
- Isn't it a beautiful wedding?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

00:17:14.742 --> 00:17:16.743
Every time, on the lips.

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.995
Why? Why on the lips?

00:17:22.374 --> 00:17:24.959
There's Frannie.
Won't she be happy to see me?

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:27.128
Now, wait a minute.
You be nice, all right?

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.547
I didn't bring you here
so you could ambush her.

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:32.925
Frannie was the one who found
your Playboys and showed them to Mom.

00:17:33.093 --> 00:17:34.302
That bitch.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.101
Monica. What...?

00:17:42.269 --> 00:17:44.979
Am I doing here? Surprised to see me?

00:17:45.147 --> 00:17:47.482
Ross brought me.
How do you like that?

00:17:47.649 --> 00:17:49.984
Hi, Frannie. Congratulations.

00:17:51.862 --> 00:17:55.156
You invite my brother, you invite
my whole family, and not me? Why?

00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:57.075
Why wouldn't you want me
at your wedding?

00:17:57.242 --> 00:17:58.743
What could I have possibly done?

00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:02.246
Stuart.

00:18:03.165 --> 00:18:05.166
I believe you know my husband.

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:10.755
So it's really a question
of "who" could you have possibly done.

00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:21.808
- I hate this, but I have to go.
- Mm-hm.

00:18:21.975 --> 00:18:24.602
I can't miss my flight.

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:27.021
Are you sure? I bet there's
another flight to Minsk in...

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.397
July.

00:18:38.492 --> 00:18:40.910
That's really beautiful.
What does it mean?

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:43.704
"Please clean my beakers."

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.207
I don't get out of the lab much.

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:51.712
I thought it meant something else.

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.050
Yeah, well, I really actually
wanted to say, um...

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:57.385
...that.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:19:00.012
But, um, I figured
I probably shouldn't because...

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.558
...you know, I have to leave.

00:19:03.725 --> 00:19:06.936
Hmm. No, you're right. Don't say it.

00:19:08.272 --> 00:19:10.398
I do, though.

00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:14.068
I do too.

00:19:22.578 --> 00:19:24.245
Well, bye, Phoebe.

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:39.302
Okay, now's not the time, Joey, all right?
You can yell at me tomorrow.

00:19:39.469 --> 00:19:42.221
No, no. No, Pheebs.
I'm not gonna yell at you.

00:19:43.098 --> 00:19:45.266
I just started thinking
about you and David...

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:49.437
...and I remember how bummed you were
the first time he left.

00:19:51.773 --> 00:19:53.983
Oh, Pheebs, come here.

00:19:54.985 --> 00:19:58.237
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.

00:19:58.697 --> 00:20:02.158
The only guy I've ever been
crazy about is going to Minsk...

00:20:02.326 --> 00:20:05.328
...and I may never see him again.

00:20:05.662 --> 00:20:07.330
Hey, you could always visit him.

00:20:07.497 --> 00:20:10.082
Oh, right.
Like they're gonna let me have a passport.

00:20:11.543 --> 00:20:14.253
Anything I can do? Whatever you need.

00:20:16.298 --> 00:20:18.299
Well, now...

00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:23.054
...if you achieve positronic distillation
of subatomic particles before he does...

00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:24.597
...then he could come back.

00:20:31.396 --> 00:20:33.773
I could give it a shot.

00:20:39.488 --> 00:20:42.365
Oh, look. There's a piece
that doesn't have floor on it.

00:20:42.532 --> 00:20:45.826
- Stick to your side.
- Come on, now.

00:20:56.505 --> 00:20:59.090
All right, what are we having?

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:08.683
Oh, wait, I forgot my wrap.

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:11.310
Oh, okay, wait here.

00:21:28.495 --> 00:21:31.038
Hi, sweetie. Are you leaving?

00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:34.542
- Well...
- Give us a kiss. Come on.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:46.387
Why? Why on the lips?
