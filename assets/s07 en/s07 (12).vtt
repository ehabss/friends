WEBVTT

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:07.172
Ross, when's this comet thing start?

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:10.092
Well, technically, it started
7 billion years ago.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.677
- No, no.
- Oh, God.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.805
Okay. Fine, I'll stop.
No teaching, okay?

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.851
We'll just watch the pretty light
streaking across the sky.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.519
- Okay?
- Okay.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:25.399
Whose official name is Bapstein-King.
Okay! Okay!

00:00:27.068 --> 00:00:30.404
There it is. Oh, look at that!

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.532
Isn't Mother Nature amazing?

00:00:35.493 --> 00:00:37.077
That's a plane.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.915
Well, all right, 1700 bags
of peanuts flying that high...

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:43.917
...that's pretty amazing too.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.757
- I wonder if you can see my apartment.
- No, you can't.

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:53.510
- What?
- I don't know.

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.514
Man, look at all those stars.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:02.895
Infinite space. It really makes you
wonder, doesn't it?

00:01:03.188 --> 00:01:05.481
- Know what else makes you wonder?
- Huh?

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.317
Check out the rack on that chick.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.572
We've been out here for two hours...

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:59.076
...and we haven't seen any
stupid comets. Can we go now?

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:02.579
I mean, Chandler's getting chilly.

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.835
No, I'm not.

00:02:09.254 --> 00:02:11.630
Then why are you wearing
Monica's jacket?

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.092
Because it's flattering!

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:18.887
Come on, Monica. Come on, Monica.

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.433
- We're taking off too. We rented a movie.
- Oh, I won't say no to a movie.

00:02:23.643 --> 00:02:26.395
Oh, Pheebs, we just actually
wanted to be alone.

00:02:26.604 --> 00:02:28.772
- Shh. Get me out of here.
- Oh, okay.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:33.652
- Hey, Ross.
- What?

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.571
- Check this out.
- Is it the comet?

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.867
No. Look, there's a bug
stuck in tar right here.

00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:42.119
I can't believe...

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.872
I bring you to see
the Bapstein-King comet...

00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:47.583
...one of nature's
most spectacular phenomena...

00:02:47.792 --> 00:02:52.379
...and all you care about are bugs
stuck in tar and some woman.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:57.926
You know, there's two women, dude.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.888
Show me where.

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.765
Right... Right up here.

00:03:09.772 --> 00:03:12.983
Joey, where's the pipe
that was holding the door open?

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:14.443
I don't know.

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:24.661
Yeah, I do.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.499
- Joey!
- What? Hey, don't look at me!

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.463
You wanted to come up here and look
for some stupid Burger King comet.

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:38.550
It's called the
Bapstein-King comet, okay?

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:42.304
Hey, Bapstein was a very
well-respected astronomer from...

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.139
No! No!

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:46.141
No!

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.444
- Monica.
- She's sleeping.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.491
I know. Just a quick question.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:07.037
Which one was Deep Impact
and which one was Armageddon?

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:12.668
Deep Impact was the one
with Robert Duvall.

00:04:12.877 --> 00:04:16.546
Armageddon is what's going
to happen to you if you wake me up.

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.842
Sorry, I just can't sleep.

00:04:22.011 --> 00:04:23.095
Ooh!

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:29.768
Where's that book you're reading
with two women who are ice-skating...

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:32.521
...and wearing those hats
with the flowers on it.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.857
Because every time I look
at that cover, I'm like:

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:41.196
It's in the living room,
where there's also a light...

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.573
...and no one will
kick you in the shin.

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:46.493
What?

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.036
Ow!

00:04:58.881 --> 00:05:02.092
Please don't be a spaceship.
Please don't be a spaceship.

00:05:10.018 --> 00:05:11.727
Oh, thank God.

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:42.007
Hm.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.597
How could you be beeping?
I just disconnected you!

00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:50.432
I took out your battery! How can...?

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:52.976
Don't interrupt me!

00:05:54.395 --> 00:05:57.189
Monica! Monica!

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.066
Come on!

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:04.154
I can't believe this!

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:08.825
All right, well, I guess we know
what we have to do to get down.

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:10.994
Yeah, I guess we don't have a choice.

00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:15.290
Help us! Please, help us!

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:19.503
We're stuck up on the roof,
and we can't get down!

00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:22.381
Ross.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.593
I was thinking we'd just
go down the fire escape.

00:06:28.388 --> 00:06:30.472
I know. I wasn't finished.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:35.727
But don't worry!

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.898
We're gonna go down the fire escape!

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:51.493
Shh-shh-shh!

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:59.501
I'm sorry, I thought I'd make some
warm milk and it would help me sleep.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:01.044
With a wok?

00:07:02.755 --> 00:07:05.257
I thought my boring book was gonna
put you to sleep.

00:07:05.508 --> 00:07:07.843
It got interesting.

00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:10.178
Damn you, Oprah!

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:14.182
Here, let me make the milk.
I'm up anyway.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.852
You know what we could do
now that we're up?

00:07:17.061 --> 00:07:19.855
We could just talk
to each other all night long.

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:22.524
Like when we were first going out.
It'd be fun.

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.568
- Okay, that does sound fun.
- Yeah.

00:07:24.902 --> 00:07:28.280
So how bummed were you
when the second sister died, huh?

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:30.407
The second sister dies?!

00:07:35.371 --> 00:07:36.746
No.

00:07:38.666 --> 00:07:41.585
No, I was talking
about the book I was reading.

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:45.881
The second sister dies in
Archie and Jughead Double Digest?

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.217
That's correct.

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:58.810
Want to go in the bedroom?
It's more comfortable.

00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:00.729
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:05.609
Oh, wait, did you send
those contracts to Milan?

00:08:06.777 --> 00:08:10.322
- If this is your idea of sexy talk...
- No.

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.074
Seriously. Did you overnight
the contracts I gave you?

00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:14.242
What contracts?

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:18.246
Please tell me this is just one
of your jokes that I don't get. Heh, heh.

00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:19.581
Like what?

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:22.834
Like the thing when you
put the phone in your pants?

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.838
Tag, I'm serious.
This isn't funny.

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:29.633
Those contracts had to go out today.

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.843
You didn't give me any contracts.

00:08:32.094 --> 00:08:35.138
Yes, I did. I put a little
Post-it on it that said:

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:39.226
"Must go out today," and I
underlined "today" three times.

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:43.939
Then I put a little heart in the corner
because I didn't wanna seem too bossy.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.274
You never gave them to me.

00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:51.154
If we went to the office, you would see
those contracts sitting on your desk.

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:55.450
No, I'd see you looking embarrassed
because they are not on my desk.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:09:00.330
Maybe I'm embarrassed because you
talk on the phone with your crotch.

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:03.458
- You want to go to the office now?
- No.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.836
Come on, it's late.
We're not going down to the office.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:10.840
Yeah, I understand. I wouldn't
want to be proved wrong either.

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:13.301
All right, get your coat!

00:09:14.512 --> 00:09:18.557
Oh! When did you unhook this?
Nice work!

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:29.568
It won't go down any further.
It's stuck.

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:32.320
We'll just have to jump.

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:36.866
Yep. Now, we're gonna have
to make sure to land...

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:40.495
...to the right of that
patch of ice, okay?

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:44.374
Not hit the dumpster
on the other side.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:50.422
And try to avoid that weird
brownish-red stuff in the middle.

00:09:51.674 --> 00:09:54.175
So when you get down there...

00:09:56.178 --> 00:10:01.057
...you go up to the roof
and you let me in.

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:04.686
- Whoa. Wait a minute. I have to do it?
- Yeah. You'll be fine.

00:10:04.854 --> 00:10:07.522
It'll be just like
bungee jumping, you know?

00:10:07.732 --> 00:10:11.901
But instead of bouncing back up,
you won't.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.365
Well, what if I smack
my head on the concrete?

00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:21.077
Well, I'm not gonna lie to you, Joey.
It's a possibility.

00:10:24.206 --> 00:10:27.709
I don't know. Tell you what,
let's flip to see who does it.

00:10:27.918 --> 00:10:31.254
- You call it in the air, all right?
- Oh, all right. Tail. Oh!

00:10:35.092 --> 00:10:38.428
- Can you see what it is?
- No.

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:41.931
- Okay. Well, you be careful.
- No. No, Ross, stop.

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:43.266
I'm not jumping.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:47.604
Look, I have an audition tomorrow,
and I can't go if I break my leg.

00:10:47.855 --> 00:10:52.442
Well, I'm not jumping. I have a son.
He won't have a father if I die.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.569
So it looks like we're even.

00:10:59.867 --> 00:11:02.577
Okay, so this wire...

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:06.748
...is connected to this wire,
which plugs into here.

00:11:07.416 --> 00:11:10.710
Okay, so to get the beeping to stop,
all I have to do...

00:11:13.005 --> 00:11:14.255
Okay.

00:11:23.099 --> 00:11:24.933
Well done, Pheebs.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:32.607
What do you want from me?!

00:11:36.612 --> 00:11:39.114
Here's your milk.
What should we talk about?

00:11:42.284 --> 00:11:43.993
What? What? What?

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:48.665
Oh, were you sleeping, sweetie?
I'm sorry. Here.

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.714
Okay. Feel free to look...

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.800
...but I'm telling you
those contracts are not on this desk.

00:11:59.009 --> 00:12:01.636
How could you know?
Look at this mess, Tag.

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:04.973
This is what I'm talking about.
You have to be more organized.

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:09.144
You've got newspapers,
you've got magazines, you... Oh!

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:12.105
And who's this chippy?

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:14.983
A little young for you, but whatever.

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:16.317
That's my sister.

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:20.155
Really? Very cute braces.

00:12:21.031 --> 00:12:24.242
Anyway, you know what?
The point is, Tag, start looking...

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:27.704
...because you're gonna find
those contracts on your desk.

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:33.334
So when do you imagine you gave
them to me? Morning or afternoon?

00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:37.714
In the afternoon. Mr. Zelner
came into my office after lunch...

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:41.384
...he put them on my desk,
and then I put a Post-it on it...

00:12:43.429 --> 00:12:44.512
...that said:

00:12:45.222 --> 00:12:47.724
"Must go out today."

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:52.562
So you just keep looking
in there, all right?

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:00.862
Not here.

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:03.531
Puzzler.

00:13:07.119 --> 00:13:08.745
Bit of a puzzle.

00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:12.999
Why don't you check the copy room?
Maybe the contracts are in there.

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:16.044
- How could I have left them in the copy room?
- I don't know.

00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:18.713
How can your genitals
make phone calls?

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:23.218
Okay? It's not a perfect world.
Just go, please?

00:13:24.178 --> 00:13:26.054
- Fine.
- Thank you.

00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:40.902
Hello?

00:13:45.241 --> 00:13:46.574
I still don't get it.

00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:52.956
You still awake?

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:55.208
Yeah. You?

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:59.254
You do know that was me
that just said that, right?

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:04.717
Hey.

00:14:04.927 --> 00:14:06.761
As long as we're both up...

00:14:08.055 --> 00:14:09.430
Yeah?

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:15.603
I hope you're not thinking
about cleaning the living room.

00:14:20.109 --> 00:14:23.820
Man, I'm starving. What the hell
was I thinking at dinner?

00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:27.615
"Do you want soup or salad?"
Both, always order both.

00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:33.955
You know, I'm looking,
and I don't think anyone's home here.

00:14:34.123 --> 00:14:36.791
I say we just break the window...

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.293
...crawl through...

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.837
...and you know, explain later.

00:14:41.088 --> 00:14:42.964
- No one's home?
- I don't think so.

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:44.299
Hello?

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.850
So when you get in there...

00:15:00.941 --> 00:15:05.153
Okay. This is where
you and I part ways.

00:15:05.362 --> 00:15:06.613
Noisy bitch!

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:14.162
Oh, what? What are you doing?

00:15:14.622 --> 00:15:16.831
Do you know what just happened?

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.836
Yeah. We had sex
and then we fell asleep.

00:15:23.797 --> 00:15:27.258
No. We were in the middle of sex...

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.553
...and you fell asleep.

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:35.016
No. No, that's not true.

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:37.477
No, best time ever.

00:15:39.146 --> 00:15:42.023
Yeah. You rock my world.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.861
- Monica?
- What?

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:50.657
I was giving you some of
my best moves, and you missed it.

00:15:50.866 --> 00:15:55.370
So please wake up
so we can do it right.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:59.374
Okay. Okay. I'm ready.

00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:01.668
- Come on, big fella.
- Okay.

00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:03.920
- Give me the good stuff.
- Yeah.

00:16:05.047 --> 00:16:08.716
No, no, no. Don't fall asleep.

00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:13.096
Okay, I'm going
to make you some coffee.

00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:19.394
Well, I probably won't spill coffee
grounds all over the kitchen floor.

00:16:19.603 --> 00:16:21.229
Okay, I'm up. I'm up.

00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:27.735
Hi. I got you some coffee to...

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.238
So you got anything for me?

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:32.240
- Still no luck.
- Oh, my God.

00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:35.243
You checked your entire desk
and all the drawers?

00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:37.954
- Want me to check again?
- I wish you would.

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:41.916
Well, no, it's not in there.

00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:43.918
How about that drawer?

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.263
Well, it's not out here.
Any chance it could be in your office?

00:17:01.562 --> 00:17:03.146
I don't know.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.065
I mean, let me check.

00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:16.492
Any luck?

00:17:17.953 --> 00:17:20.163
Can I see you in my office for a minute?

00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:21.664
Yeah.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:24.959
You found them!

00:17:27.379 --> 00:17:28.963
I'm not even gonna gloat.

00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:32.467
- I'm just really relieved it's...
- You put these on my desk.

00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:33.801
- I did not.
- Oh, really?

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:36.095
So they slid out of your bottom drawer...

00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:38.973
...crawled across the floor,
then jumped onto my desk?

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:41.976
How did you know
they were in my bottom drawer?

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.775
I am so hot for you right now.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.583
Oh, my God!
How did you get back here?

00:18:05.793 --> 00:18:07.585
Phoebe Buffay?

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:11.756
Fire Alarm?

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:20.723
Oh, hi, Officer Fireman.
Can I help you?

00:18:20.933 --> 00:18:22.850
Your fire alarm was in the trash.

00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:24.936
- That's not mine.
- Yes, it is.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:26.104
How do you know?

00:18:26.271 --> 00:18:29.232
If you dump a fire alarm,
don't use a blanket that says:

00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:32.401
"Property of Phoebe Buffay,
not Monica."

00:18:33.403 --> 00:18:35.113
Do you have a search warrant?

00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:38.783
Because the last time I checked,
this was still America.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:42.912
Please reattach it.
It's against the law to disconnect them.

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:47.208
Fine. But please, God, tell me
how to stop it from going off?

00:18:47.417 --> 00:18:49.001
Press the reset button.

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:52.839
There's a reset button?
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

00:18:53.048 --> 00:18:55.925
Oh. There's a reset button?

00:18:56.176 --> 00:18:58.177
My God!

00:18:58.428 --> 00:18:59.971
Why didn't I see that?

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:04.976
Reset button. Reset button.

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:08.396
Where is there a reset button?
Oh, here it is! Oh!

00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:22.994
God!

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.667
- Okay, you have a good grip?
- Yeah.

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:32.712
Okay, I'm gonna start
to climb down you now.

00:19:35.757 --> 00:19:37.675
- All right, just hurry up.
- Okay.

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:41.304
Now, should I climb down your front
so we're face to face...

00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:45.016
...or should I climb down
your back so we're...

00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:46.976
...butt to face?

00:19:48.312 --> 00:19:50.688
- Face to face.
- I like face to face.

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.400
- Okay, here I come.
- All right.

00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:00.364
Oh, my... How much do you weigh, Ross?

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:06.495
I prefer not to answer that right now.
I'm still carrying a little holiday weight.

00:20:14.087 --> 00:20:16.339
When we talked about face to face...

00:20:16.548 --> 00:20:19.425
...I don't think we thought it
all the way through.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:23.888
- What do you want me to do?
- Just shimmy down me and drop.

00:20:29.144 --> 00:20:30.686
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:20:32.439 --> 00:20:36.067
You know, maybe I should hang,
and you should climb down me.

00:20:36.276 --> 00:20:39.862
Yeah? Maybe we should talk
about that for a little while!

00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:44.992
- It still looks pretty far.
- It's not that far. Just drop.

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:46.953
Do not rush me!

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:59.715
Ross, my pants are starting to come down,
and I'm not wearing any underwear.

00:21:01.843 --> 00:21:02.843
Whoa!

00:21:04.304 --> 00:21:07.807
Ow! My ankle!
I really hurt my ankle!

00:21:08.058 --> 00:21:11.560
I think I twisted it when...
Ooh, a quarter!

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:19.777
That really was
some of your best work.

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:21.195
I told you.

00:21:25.325 --> 00:21:26.492
I can't believe it.

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:30.830
I've only got two hours
until I call in sick for work.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:33.332
I have to be up in seven minutes.

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:38.546
Well, you're not gonna believe this,
but if you have seven minutes...

00:21:39.256 --> 00:21:40.840
Really?

00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:42.758
You want to?

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:46.429
Okay. You get the vacuum cleaner.
I'll get the furniture polish.
