WEBVTT

00:00:02.293 --> 00:00:03.752
So thanks for coming by, guys.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.172
We wanted to bounce some ideas off
of you about the wedding ceremony.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.799
Oh.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.011
- What's the matter? Are you okay?
- Yeah, it's just...

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.722
Monica said "wedding."

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.642
Uh, so we wanted to know if one of you
would like to read something.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.438
Okay, yeah, I guess I can do that too.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.357
Too?

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:29.486
Yeah, I kind of, ahem, have something else
planned for you guys.

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:32.573
- Do you mind telling us what it is?
- Sorry.

00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.993
I'm kind of keeping this one
on the QT.

00:00:36.161 --> 00:00:38.829
Well, whatever it is,
I hope it involves winking.

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:42.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:45.044
So I talked to one of the DOOL writers...

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.296
- What is DOOL?
- Days Of Our Lives.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.177
You're not gonna believe it.
My character is coming out of his coma!

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.012
- That's wonderful.
- Wow, Joey.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.266
And not only that.
I'm getting a new brain!

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:04.480
So great things are happening at work
and in your personal life.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:07.274
What do you mean
you're getting a new brain?

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:10.360
They're killing off one of the characters,
and when she dies...

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:13.322
...and her brain is being transplanted
into my body.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:18.702
Heh, what? A brain transplant?

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:20.496
It's ridiculous.

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:24.208
I think it's ridiculous that you haven't
had sex in three and a half months.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.382
It's winter.
There are fewer people on the street.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.135
Who are they killing off?

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:37.805
Uh, Cecilia Monroe.
She plays Jessica Lockhart.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:39.765
- No!
- No!

00:01:40.225 --> 00:01:43.811
She is so good at throwing drinks
in people's faces.

00:01:44.062 --> 00:01:46.730
I don't think I've ever seen
her finish a beverage.

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.650
The way she slaps people.
Wouldn't you love to do that?

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:51.276
Don't do it.

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.987
And she's been on the show forever.

00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:56.949
- It's gonna be really hard to fill her shoes.
- Yeah.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:58.575
Help me out here. When you...

00:01:58.743 --> 00:02:03.247
When you come out
of the "brain transplant"...

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:06.166
...you are going to be her?

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:09.253
Yes, but in Drake Ramoray's body.

00:02:12.173 --> 00:02:15.759
Why is this so hard for you to get?
I thought you were a scientist.

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:56.508
Rach, so that guy there:

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:57.843
Straight or gay?

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.554
Oh.

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:03.682
Oh, yeah, he's too cute
to be straight. Ha, ha.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.227
Ooh, Knockers will help us
figure it out.

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:14.651
All right, straight.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:17.654
And not subtle.

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.450
- He left his cell phone.
- Oh?

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:24.369
We could hand it to Gunther,
he'll put it in lost and found.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:28.081
Or we could use it to call China,
see how those guys are doing.

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:32.794
What if, uh, he calls his own cell phone
to find out who found it, and I answer...

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:35.589
...and we start talking
and we fell in love?

00:03:35.798 --> 00:03:37.966
Wouldn't that be a great story?

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.720
- Kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age.
- Yeah.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:44.056
That does sound great.
I'm gonna get the phone.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:47.559
What? Wait.
Why do you get the story?

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.479
I don't know. I haven't been
out on a date in so long.

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.190
Phoebe, you had a date three days ago.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:58.028
That wasn't a date. That was friends
getting together and having sex.

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.405
Okay. Great. See, I get the phone.

00:04:00.573 --> 00:04:03.825
No way. You just broke up with Tag
a week ago.

00:04:03.993 --> 00:04:09.289
Yeah, and until now,
I didn't think I would love again.

00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.583
- Nice try.
- Hey, wait.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.962
How do we fairly decide
who gets the phone?

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:16.964
I don't know.

00:04:22.053 --> 00:04:23.220
Well, um...

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.348
Maybe we could, uh...

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:30.102
Ah-ha! Too slow! Ha-ha-ha.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.647
Ah-ha! Too cocky.

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.487
I'm going to date him.
There's nothing you can do.

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:41.780
Yes, there is.

00:04:41.948 --> 00:04:45.158
What, are you going to kill him
like you did Charles?

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.997
Oh, my baby.

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:55.836
Cut!

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:04.594
That was a great scene. And that slap
looked so real. How do you do that?

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:08.432
- Oh, just years of experience.
- Can I get some ice here?

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:12.936
Anyway, I just wanted to say
how wonderful I think you are.

00:05:13.354 --> 00:05:15.856
You're not the fan who's dying,
are you?

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:20.068
No, uh, I'm Joey Tribbiani.
We did a scene together yesterday.

00:05:20.278 --> 00:05:23.655
- I'm the guy in the coma.
- Oh, that was a real person?

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:30.037
I wanted to say, since I'm getting your brain
when you leave the show...

00:05:30.204 --> 00:05:33.415
...I was wondering if there was any tips...
- I'm leaving the show?

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.876
I don't know, why?
Did you hear something?

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.088
- Who told you that?
- Oh, uh...

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.508
- One of the writers.
- Which? Was it bald or was it tall?

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.679
You know, it doesn't matter,
because it is not true.

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:48.972
Okay. Whoo, eh.

00:05:49.223 --> 00:05:52.893
And if it were true, how dare you come
to me and ask me for tips...

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:55.854
...about a character I've been playing
for 20 years!

00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:04.446
Miss Monroe... Oh, there you go.

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:09.576
Okay, look, I have an idea.

00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:13.580
Why don't we see what kind of numbers
he has on his speed dial?

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.792
And then from that, we can tell
who has more in common with him...

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:18.877
...and whoever does gets the phone.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:22.339
- Fine. All right.
- All right.

00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:25.884
- First name on the speed dial is "Mom."
- Oh.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.929
I lost my mom to suicide.

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:30.180
Okay, no way.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:33.058
You can't use that to get the cute guy
and the last muffin.

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.144
Did I use that already today? I'm sorry.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.690
"Ben, Carlos, David..."

00:06:40.858 --> 00:06:43.860
Oh, I win. He's got Barney's
on his speed dial.

00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:46.363
So? You don't know
that it's Barney's the store.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.491
That could be his friend's house,
or a bar, or...

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.244
Who has Barney's the store
on their speed dial?

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:54.579
His new girlfriend.

00:07:08.636 --> 00:07:09.928
What is that?

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:12.848
I think it's the Dying Cat Parade.

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:17.853
Sounds like it's coming
from across the street.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:21.440
- Oh, my God.
- What?

00:07:21.607 --> 00:07:23.900
The thing that Ross was gonna
do at our wedding?

00:07:24.152 --> 00:07:28.363
He was hanging out with me yesterday
and he said, "You're half Scottish, right?"

00:07:28.531 --> 00:07:31.825
No. There is no way.
It cannot be Ross.

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:43.420
Unbelievable.
Why is your family Scottish?

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.591
Why is your family Ross?

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:52.262
He cannot play at our wedding.
Everyone will leave.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.307
I mean, come on. That is just noise!

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.392
It's not even a song.

00:07:57.977 --> 00:08:01.188
Wait. If you listen very carefully, I think...

00:08:01.355 --> 00:08:04.149
...it's "Celebration" by Kool and the Gang.

00:08:10.239 --> 00:08:13.366
You're absolutely right.
They are writing me out of the show.

00:08:13.534 --> 00:08:17.162
They don't know exactly when it's going
to happen, but apparently it's soon...

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:18.830
...and then that's it.

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:22.125
I'm sorry. If it was up to me,
you would never leave the show.

00:08:22.293 --> 00:08:24.294
- Yeah, thanks.
- No, I mean it.

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:27.797
I can't believe they'd do this to you.
And to your fans.

00:08:28.007 --> 00:08:32.385
They're gonna be devastated.
Heartbroken. They love you so much.

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:34.888
Oh, you're right.

00:08:35.556 --> 00:08:36.806
Thank you.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.850
- What's your name again?
- Uh...

00:08:39.977 --> 00:08:41.811
- Joey.
- Joey. Well, thank you.

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:44.606
That is so sweet. Oh.

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:47.192
The... The only reason
I came up to you before...

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.236
...was because, well...

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:52.614
...because I'm really nervous
about being you.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:56.576
You know, if you could help me capture
the essence of the character.

00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:59.704
Help me keep Jessica alive. Please?

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:03.708
All right, Joey, I will help you.

00:09:03.876 --> 00:09:07.420
Not because I owe it
to this stupid show...

00:09:07.588 --> 00:09:10.840
...but because I owe it to Jessica.

00:09:11.008 --> 00:09:13.885
- Oh, that's great. Thank you so much.
- You're so welcome.

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:16.763
I've been watching some tapes.
How's this?

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:21.101
Jessica Lockhart
will never step foot in this place again!

00:09:21.269 --> 00:09:22.602
Ever!

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.692
Oh, but, Jessica doesn't have
an English accent.

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:31.027
I can do an English accent?

00:09:33.155 --> 00:09:35.156
That baby's going on my resume.

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.663
- Hi, Pheebs. How are you?
- Good.

00:09:41.831 --> 00:09:44.583
Um, Phoebe, remember when we were
in the coffeehouse...

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.877
...we decided I was gonna keep
the cute guy's phone?

00:09:48.045 --> 00:09:50.589
- Yeah.
- And I was gonna keep it in my purse...

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:53.550
...so if it rang, I could just pick it up?
- Yeah.

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:58.138
And then do you remember going
into my purse and stealing the phone?

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:00.974
Ooh, now you lost me.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:03.602
- You stole the phone.
- No, I didn't.

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:06.813
No? So you're saying that if I called it,
it wouldn't ring?

00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:08.148
- No.
- Hmm. Okay.

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:11.985
But while you dial, let me show you
the features of my new ringing handbag.

00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.194
Mm.

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.656
Oh, it does work.

00:10:18.075 --> 00:10:20.076
- Phoebe.
- That is a different phone.

00:10:20.244 --> 00:10:24.914
Oh, is it? Hello. Yes, hi.
Is Rachel there?

00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:28.627
Yes, she is. Just one moment, please.
It's for me!

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.422
- That is damning evidence.
- Ugh.

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:37.677
Oh, my God. I bet that's him.

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:40.180
My digital fairy tale's about to begin.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:42.766
It's ri...

00:10:42.933 --> 00:10:45.143
Would you stop doing that?

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:48.313
Hello? Yes, I'm the one
who found your phone.

00:10:48.481 --> 00:10:51.107
- Phoebe, you can't do th...
- Shh, I'm on a call.

00:10:53.319 --> 00:10:57.280
Well, yeah, I mean, you could
pick it up tonight. Say, 8:30?

00:10:57.448 --> 00:11:00.241
At my apartment. It's, um...

00:11:00.409 --> 00:11:03.953
It's, um, 5 Morton Street, apartment 14.

00:11:04.121 --> 00:11:08.375
And then maybe, you know, after,
we could grab a bite to eat or whatever.

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:11.044
Okay. Okay, I'll see you then. Bye.

00:11:13.422 --> 00:11:16.049
You do know that I will be here
when he comes over.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.468
Oh, and how will you know what time
to come over?

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:20.970
You just said it.

00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:25.183
Oh.

00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:33.525
Joey, the essence of the character
is rooted in her confidence.

00:11:33.693 --> 00:11:37.320
So when Jessica enters a room,
for instance...

00:11:37.488 --> 00:11:39.531
...she owns everything...

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:43.576
...and every person in that room.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:46.663
- You try it.
- Okay.

00:11:54.922 --> 00:11:57.006
Right. Well, he's not mad at the room.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.428
Try it again. He owns it.
He owns the room.

00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:06.266
It is his. He owns, owns,
owns the room! He owns it!

00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:09.185
It's a little weird,
but it's getting better.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:15.275
Oh, I'm gonna miss this woman so much.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:17.944
It's been 20 years of my life.

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:22.115
Hey, hey. Maybe... Maybe, uh...
Maybe this is a good thing.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:26.161
You know? It'll give you a chance to shake
things up. Play different characters.

00:12:26.328 --> 00:12:27.829
You're so talented.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:32.584
Probably should've just left years ago
when the offers were pouring in...

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:35.628
...but, you know,
I just got so comfy here and...

00:12:35.796 --> 00:12:38.673
Ugh, I turned down some amazing work.

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:41.134
- Like what?
- Well...

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:43.887
...let's just say if I'd left 15 years ago...

00:12:44.054 --> 00:12:48.808
...the landscape of Mexican
cinema would be very different today.

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.479
Wow.

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:58.943
But, well, now...
Now's a different time for me.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.783
Oh, hey, come on. Don't, uh...
Don't do this.

00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:07.285
Let me tell you something, okay?

00:13:07.536 --> 00:13:12.081
When I watch you do a scene,
I'm thinking, "Boy, she is a great actress."

00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:16.711
But... But I'm also thinking, "She is hot."

00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:21.382
You think I'm hot?

00:13:22.718 --> 00:13:24.636
You own the room.

00:13:29.016 --> 00:13:31.059
We... We should probably get the...

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.478
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we should get...

00:13:37.775 --> 00:13:41.820
So when Jessica kisses a man...

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:45.281
...she usually puts, um...

00:13:45.449 --> 00:13:48.660
...both her hands on the man's face.

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.412
Yeah, I notice that.
Is that because she's so passionate?

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.958
No, it's because that way
the camera only sees her.

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.755
You want to try it?

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.091
Yeah, okay.

00:14:15.271 --> 00:14:17.897
That was good. That was really good.

00:14:19.567 --> 00:14:22.986
But I think that maybe
your hands are just a little off.

00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:25.363
- They should be, maybe... Like, right...
- Mm.

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:35.790
Well, I feel like a snack.

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:39.669
Do you want some shortbread?
It's Scottish, like you are.

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.299
Oh, no, thanks. I don't like anything
from my Scottish heritage.

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.050
What?

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:50.722
Well, it's just that my entire family
was run out of Scotland by...

00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:53.516
...Vikings.

00:14:54.351 --> 00:14:59.147
It sounds to me like your family's ready
to, uh, rediscover its Scottish roots.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:01.691
You can't play bagpipes
at the wedding!

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:04.777
How did you know about that?

00:15:04.945 --> 00:15:07.280
We heard you play
all the way from your apartment.

00:15:07.448 --> 00:15:09.782
Were you the ones who called the cops?

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:13.328
That's not really important right now.
Ahem.

00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:17.081
What is important is,
while we appreciate the gesture...

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:21.461
...we just don't feel that bagpipes
are appropriate for our wedding.

00:15:21.712 --> 00:15:25.298
- Why not?
- Because we hate them.

00:15:25.466 --> 00:15:29.302
Just give me a chance to perform for you,
and then decide whatever you want.

00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:33.056
I'm not gonna tell you what song
I'm gonna play, either. But, uh...

00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:35.099
...let's just say when it's over...

00:15:35.267 --> 00:15:39.103
...I'll bet there'll be
a wee bit o' celebration.

00:15:46.236 --> 00:15:48.029
Hey, hey!

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:51.824
Who is it?

00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:53.034
Hi, It's Tom.

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:55.078
- I'm here to pick up the phone.
- Ah!

00:15:56.121 --> 00:15:58.498
Whoa, why do you
get to answer the door?

00:15:58.666 --> 00:16:01.501
- Why shouldn't I?
- Because it's my apartment.

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:03.878
Well, then I get to give him the phone.

00:16:04.046 --> 00:16:07.423
Okay. Good luck explaining
all the calls to China.

00:16:10.427 --> 00:16:11.719
Hi.

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:18.101
Wow, how long were we arguing for?

00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:22.522
Um, ha, ha.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.941
You're not the man
who left the cell phone.

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:28.236
- No, that's my assistant.
- Is he coming?

00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:30.697
Um, no.

00:16:30.864 --> 00:16:33.324
Could you, uh, give us one second?

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:36.035
- Sure.
- We'll be right back, sir.

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:41.124
- Well, what do we do?
- I don't know.

00:16:41.291 --> 00:16:42.625
Can you believe this?

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:46.045
We were waiting for a hot guy
and an even hotter one shows up.

00:16:46.213 --> 00:16:47.922
I know...

00:16:51.552 --> 00:16:53.011
What?

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.345
Rachel, listen...

00:16:54.513 --> 00:16:58.725
...if you let me have him,
then I will really owe you one.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.228
All right.

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:06.399
All right, Phoebe, I will let you have him.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:08.776
But you owe me. You owe me big.

00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:12.488
So which one of you lovely ladies
am I gonna take to dinner, huh?

00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:14.824
Oh, that'd be me, sir.

00:17:16.035 --> 00:17:18.202
- After you.
- Okay, thank you.

00:17:19.621 --> 00:17:20.997
Nice.

00:17:26.503 --> 00:17:29.881
Well, you certainly own that room.

00:17:31.967 --> 00:17:33.551
Actually, I rent the whole place.

00:17:33.719 --> 00:17:36.054
And I just got what you meant.
Thank you.

00:17:39.224 --> 00:17:40.808
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:17:42.352 --> 00:17:45.897
Oh, my God.

00:17:46.065 --> 00:17:50.401
Aah! Jessica Lockhart!
In my apartment!

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:53.905
I am such a huge fan.
I am such a huge fan.

00:17:54.073 --> 00:17:55.490
Well, it's nice to know that...

00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:58.201
Monica! Monica!

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:01.204
That, uh... That's my roommate, Rachel.

00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:03.498
Oh, that explains
all the women's underwear.

00:18:03.665 --> 00:18:05.333
Sure. Yeah.

00:18:06.001 --> 00:18:09.128
Oh, my God, it's true!

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:11.464
Oh, my God.

00:18:11.632 --> 00:18:14.801
Can I just ask you to do me...
Aw... Just one favor?

00:18:14.968 --> 00:18:16.469
Certainly.

00:18:16.637 --> 00:18:19.514
Would you slap me?
Would you slap me right here in the face?

00:18:21.141 --> 00:18:24.268
I'd love to, but my lawyer said
I can't do that anymore.

00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:28.356
- All right, here we go.
- Okay.

00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:31.567
No, wait. Just one moment. Um...

00:18:32.736 --> 00:18:34.987
- You're a stupid bitch.
- I really can't slap you.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:40.535
- My God, you're great.
- Thanks for stopping by. See you.

00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:44.539
- I am so sorry about that.
- Oh, no, no, no.

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:47.667
Being adored, I'm used to it.
Don't worry about it.

00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:50.545
- Oh, my God.
- What?

00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:53.714
They sent me today's script.
They never send me the script.

00:18:53.882 --> 00:18:56.092
- They don't?
- Well, no, I'm in a coma.

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.678
This must mean I have lines.

00:19:00.347 --> 00:19:01.973
Oh.

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:04.725
How does it happen?

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:08.646
Ooh.

00:19:08.814 --> 00:19:12.441
You get thrown from a horse
into an electric fence.

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.696
A what? Jessica hates horses.

00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:20.783
I'm guessing after this she's not
gonna be crazy about electricity, either.

00:19:25.622 --> 00:19:29.500
Loosening the saddle on Mother's horse
was brilliant, Fredrick.

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:32.211
And the electric fence, inspired.

00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:33.796
Thank you, sweetheart.

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:37.175
I can't believe she's really gone.

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:40.469
Look around you. All of this is ours.

00:19:40.637 --> 00:19:42.555
I don't think so.

00:19:47.603 --> 00:19:48.811
Who are you?

00:19:48.979 --> 00:19:50.813
What's the matter, Dina?

00:19:50.981 --> 00:19:53.774
Don't you recognize your own...

00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:55.401
...mother?

00:19:58.363 --> 00:20:01.073
Cut! That was great,
everybody. Thank you.

00:20:01.241 --> 00:20:03.618
That was so wonderful!

00:20:03.785 --> 00:20:07.205
Oh, I think that you're a better
Jessica than I ever was.

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:10.249
- Oh, no.
- Of course not, but you were very good.

00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:11.667
Heh, thanks.

00:20:11.835 --> 00:20:14.212
Guess what? Good news.
I got another job.

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:16.797
Great. Hey, all right! What is it?

00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:19.300
A film in Guadalajara.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.053
The airport?

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:25.514
No, that's LaGuardia.

00:20:29.228 --> 00:20:32.563
- This is Mexico.
- Oh, wow.

00:20:32.814 --> 00:20:35.107
Well, how long will you be gone?

00:20:35.275 --> 00:20:37.193
Eight months.

00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:41.697
- That's a really long time.
- Yeah, but you could come and visit me.

00:20:41.865 --> 00:20:46.202
I bet that you could, uh,
own a few places down there.

00:20:46.954 --> 00:20:51.082
Oh, you know, I should probably
buy a place in the city first.

00:20:53.126 --> 00:20:55.419
And I just got what you meant.
That is a...

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:58.339
- I'll tell you, that's a tricky one.
- It's a tricky one.

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:00.049
Well...

00:21:02.219 --> 00:21:03.469
Good luck.

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:05.805
You too.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:24.865
Ahem. Okay, now, uh,
remember, I'm still learning.

00:21:34.584 --> 00:21:36.794
One, two, three, four!

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:57.481
You know the song. Sing along.

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:15.916
So?

00:22:16.626 --> 00:22:17.793
- No!
- No!
