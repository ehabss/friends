WEBVTT

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:05.170
- Hi.
- Hi! Hi, Ben.

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:07.506
- Hi.
- We have a bathroom emergency.

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.217
- Oh, yeah. Go ahead.
- Okay, uh, before we do...

00:00:10.385 --> 00:00:14.596
...uh, are any of Joey's special
romance magazines in there?

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.643
- No.
- Okay, all clear.

00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.645
Thanks, Phoebe.

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:25.399
That's Rachel.

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:27.443
- But whatever.
- Mm-hm.

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.155
Could you do me a big favor?

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:34.158
The, uh, dean's office called
and said there was an urgent meeting.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.535
Can you watch Ben for an hour?

00:00:37.662 --> 00:00:40.414
- Well, what about Monica?
- Uh, she isn't home.

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:44.585
So it would just be me alone?

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:48.672
- Well, Ben would be there.
- No...

00:00:49.507 --> 00:00:50.758
Huh. Um...

00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:53.469
- What's the matter?
- Well, uh, you know, it's just, uh...

00:00:53.636 --> 00:00:56.764
I've never done that before.
Me and him, alone.

00:00:56.931 --> 00:00:58.474
He's not an ex-con.

00:00:58.683 --> 00:01:00.851
Okay, okay, okay. Um...

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.979
- What do I do with him?
- I don't know, talk to him.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:06.148
Entertain him. Keep him alive.

00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:10.444
- Okay.
- Okay, Ben, come here.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:14.865
I'm gonna leave you here with
Aunt Rachel for about an hour, okay?

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:16.075
Gonna be okay?

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:18.285
- I think so.
- I wasn't talking to you.

00:01:57.158 --> 00:02:00.119
What about the second minister?
I kind of liked him.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:04.414
- You mean the spitter?
- Come on. He wasn't that bad.

00:02:04.582 --> 00:02:07.251
Easy for you to say,
you'd be wearing a veil.

00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:11.922
- And the third guy?
- He kept staring at your chest.

00:02:12.465 --> 00:02:13.882
Can you blame him?

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.845
I don't like the idea of me saying, "I do"...

00:02:18.096 --> 00:02:20.180
...while he's thinking, "I'd do it too."

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.352
- Well, then we still have a problem.
- With what?

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.521
We need someone
to perform our wedding...

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.857
...and they're all either
boring or annoying...

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:32.359
...or keep staring at the ladies.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.781
Ooh, you should have one of us do it.

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:41.118
We're getting "married" married,
not "6th-grade" married.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.704
No, it's a real thing.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:47.833
Anyone can be ordained on the Internet
and perform weddings and stuff.

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:49.585
I call it!

00:02:50.628 --> 00:02:52.629
What? It was my idea!

00:02:52.797 --> 00:02:56.133
Thank you very much,
but neither of you is marrying us.

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:58.468
Does calling it not mean
anything anymore?

00:02:59.637 --> 00:03:02.139
We're having a legitimate clergy member.

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:04.975
And when I say legitimate, I mean gay...

00:03:05.226 --> 00:03:07.811
...and in control of his saliva.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.201
Ben, you know, when, uh...
When you were a baby...

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.328
...we'd hang out all the time.

00:03:24.495 --> 00:03:26.288
Because I was your daddy's girlfriend.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:28.624
But you're not anymore.

00:03:30.501 --> 00:03:33.503
- No, I'm not.
- Because you guys were on a break...

00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.839
Hey, we were not on a... Okay.

00:03:39.427 --> 00:03:43.096
- When's my daddy coming back?
- Fifty-two minutes.

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.270
So no brothers or sisters, huh?

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:53.357
You know what, I had two sisters
and we just tortured each other.

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:57.819
- Really? Like how?
- Well, you know, we would, um...

00:03:57.987 --> 00:04:00.530
We'd repeat everything the other said...

00:04:00.698 --> 00:04:04.326
...or, uh, we'd jump out of closets
to scare each other...

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:08.288
...or, ha, switch the sugar for the salt
so they put salt on their cereal.

00:04:08.498 --> 00:04:09.623
That's a good one.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:13.418
- Yeah, you like that one?
- Yeah, you're funny.

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.046
I'm funny?

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:18.048
Oh, thank God.

00:04:18.466 --> 00:04:20.008
Well, hey, I got a ton of these.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.427
Um, you, uh... You take a quarter...

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.179
You take a quarter...

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:27.891
...and you blacken the edge, right?

00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:31.520
And then you say,
"I bet you can't roll this quarter...

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:34.064
...to your chin without it leaving your face."

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:39.611
And when they do it, they're left with
a line down the center of their face.

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.697
Can I do it to you?

00:04:43.074 --> 00:04:45.742
Yeah, I'm funny, Ben, but I'm not stupid.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.327
Heh, okay?

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:54.501
So did you, uh,
find anyone to marry you guys yet?

00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:57.963
No, but "Horny for Monica" minister called...

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:01.216
...wondering if we're still together.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.554
- We'll never find anybody.
- Then let me do it.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.639
- Joe...
- No, I've been thinking.

00:05:07.807 --> 00:05:11.059
I'm an actor, so I won't
get nervous in front of people.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:14.813
I won't spit and I won't stare
at Monica's breasts.

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:18.275
Everyone knows I'm an ass man.

00:05:19.736 --> 00:05:21.862
- That is true.
- And the most important thing...

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.574
...is it won't be some stranger
who barely knows you.

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:29.369
It'll be me. And I swear,
I'll do a really good job.

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:33.040
Plus, I love you guys
and it would really mean a lot to me.

00:05:35.126 --> 00:05:36.376
Might be kind of cool.

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:38.795
- So I can do it?
- Yeah, you can do it.

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:40.047
All right! Okay!

00:05:42.091 --> 00:05:44.468
Okay, I gotta get started
on my speech.

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.011
Wait a minute.

00:05:46.637 --> 00:05:49.639
- Internet ministers can still have sex?
- Yeah.

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.020
Coming.

00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:06.239
I have a bone to pick with you.

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.868
- Uh-oh.
- Yes.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.412
Ben learned a little trick.

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.460
- Oh, did he pull the old...?
- That's right, that's right.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.631
Saran wrap on the toilet seat...

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.759
...so the pee goes everywhere.

00:06:27.637 --> 00:06:29.971
- Oh, that.
- Yeah, that.

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:32.474
You know I hate practical jokes.

00:06:32.725 --> 00:06:36.645
They're mean, they're stupid
and I don't want my son learning them.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:41.274
Oh, come on. Saran wrap on the toilet seat?
Isn't that just a little funny?

00:06:41.442 --> 00:06:42.776
- I was barefoot.
- Oh.

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:48.573
Tell me, the toilet thing is the
only thing you taught him, right?

00:06:52.703 --> 00:06:53.745
Yes.

00:06:56.749 --> 00:07:00.419
- Hey.
- Say hello to Reverend Joey Tribbiani.

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:02.754
- You got ordained?
- Yeah.

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:06.508
Just got off the Internet.
Man, there's a lot of porn out there.

00:07:08.177 --> 00:07:10.178
Our minister.

00:07:10.638 --> 00:07:13.306
I started on what I'm gonna say
for the ceremony. Want to hear it?

00:07:13.474 --> 00:07:16.476
- Yeah.
- Listen, this is just the first draft, so...

00:07:18.604 --> 00:07:21.773
"We are gathered here today
on this joyous occasion...

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:25.986
...to celebrate the special love
that Monica and Chandler share.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:27.946
Huh? Right.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:31.992
It is a love based on giving and receiving...

00:07:32.243 --> 00:07:34.828
...as well as having and sharing.

00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:40.208
And the love that they give and have
is shared and received.

00:07:42.086 --> 00:07:44.880
And through this having and giving...

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:48.300
...and sharing and receiving...

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:54.055
...we too can share and love and have...

00:07:54.682 --> 00:07:56.600
...and receive."

00:07:59.604 --> 00:08:01.605
Should we call the spitter?

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:12.324
- Ha! Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.993
What a surprise.
What are you doing here?

00:08:15.703 --> 00:08:17.954
I was just in the neighborhood...

00:08:18.122 --> 00:08:21.750
...and I passed by your building
and thought, "What's up with Carol...

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:23.418
...and sweet little Ben?"

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:27.047
- That's nice. Well, uh, come on in.
- Okay.

00:08:27.215 --> 00:08:30.258
Um, I'll make some coffee
and, uh, we can chat.

00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:32.344
I'd love that. I would love that.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.973
So, uh... So where is sweet little Ben?

00:08:37.141 --> 00:08:38.433
I would love to have a little...

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:43.980
I found him!

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.400
Very funny. Come here.

00:08:47.944 --> 00:08:51.446
That is exactly why I've come here
to talk to you, okay?

00:08:51.697 --> 00:08:54.157
- Rach, you want some sugar?
- Yes, but...

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:55.700
Do I want sugar in my coffee?

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:02.666
No, just some milk would
be good, Carol. Thanks.

00:09:02.917 --> 00:09:05.835
Okay. Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?

00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:09.047
"Remember all that stuff
I taught you yesterday?"

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:11.550
- Don't do that.
- "Don't do that."

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:15.720
- Your dad doesn't like pranks.
- "Your dad doesn't like pranks."

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:18.014
- Oh, damn it.
- "Oh, damn it!"

00:09:18.182 --> 00:09:20.517
No! Don't say that.

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:22.394
- Damn it!
- Go back to repeating.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:24.187
- Damn it!
- Oh, crap.

00:09:24.355 --> 00:09:26.606
- "Oh, crap!"
- Oh.

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:33.947
Okay, I got some more written, ready?

00:09:36.325 --> 00:09:38.368
Yeah, okay.

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:43.164
"When I think of the love that these
two givers and receivers share...

00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:48.336
...I can't help but envy the lifetime
ahead of having and loving...

00:09:48.504 --> 00:09:52.841
...and giving..." And then I can't
think of a good word for right here.

00:09:53.009 --> 00:09:55.802
- How about "receiving"?
- Yes!

00:09:57.972 --> 00:10:01.766
See, Joe, not that that's not great...

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:06.396
...but one cool thing about having
a friend perform the ceremony...

00:10:06.564 --> 00:10:08.315
...is that it can be about us.

00:10:08.482 --> 00:10:12.027
It can be more personal.
You can tell stories about us.

00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:13.361
Ooh, ooh.

00:10:13.529 --> 00:10:17.699
Uh, okay. Maybe I'll talk about London.
You know, when you two hooked up.

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:20.660
Only I won't say "hooked up"...

00:10:20.828 --> 00:10:23.997
...I'll say, "began their beautiful journey...

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.666
- There you go.
...by doing it."

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:31.755
- Joe.
- Okay, all right, um...

00:10:31.922 --> 00:10:35.634
So, uh... So how did it happen?
Did your eyes meet across the room...

00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:39.512
...then you're in the bathtub
and she's feeding you strawberries?

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:44.309
- Isn't that what happened to you?
- Yeah!

00:10:46.687 --> 00:10:49.064
I call that "London style."

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.025
That didn't happen with us.

00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:56.029
Ooh, but maybe you should say it is,
because "London style" sounds nice.

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:57.238
Yeah.

00:10:57.406 --> 00:10:59.366
Okay, uh...

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:04.162
I was sad that night because
this guy thought I was Ross' mom.

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.372
Ah.

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:08.958
And Chandler was really sweet
and he consoled me...

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.878
...and we drank too much.
- Yeah, baby.

00:11:14.131 --> 00:11:18.927
I was a gentleman and I walked her
to her hotel room and said good night.

00:11:19.428 --> 00:11:20.637
Oh.

00:11:20.805 --> 00:11:24.474
- But then, later that night...
- Yeah, baby.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:34.401
Hey.

00:11:34.568 --> 00:11:38.196
Cute P.J.s. Really living it up
here in London, huh?

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:43.618
Well, I wasn't exactly
expecting company after...

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:46.121
...9:15.

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:48.331
Is Joey here?

00:11:48.582 --> 00:11:53.002
Last I saw he was with a bridesmaid
and a bucket of strawberries.

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:57.590
So, uh, you're not still upset
about what that guy told you, are you?

00:11:58.592 --> 00:11:59.926
Wouldn't you be?

00:12:00.344 --> 00:12:04.264
It's been a really emotional time
and you've had a lot to drink...

00:12:04.473 --> 00:12:06.182
You have to let that go, okay?

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:09.477
You were the most beautiful woman
in the room tonight.

00:12:10.521 --> 00:12:11.563
Really?

00:12:11.731 --> 00:12:15.233
You kidding? You're the most
beautiful woman in most rooms...

00:12:22.783 --> 00:12:25.744
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
We just made out.

00:12:25.953 --> 00:12:28.288
- We're making out?
- Not anymore.

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:32.876
- But we don't do that.
- I know, I thought it would be fun.

00:12:34.128 --> 00:12:35.170
How drunk are you?

00:12:35.337 --> 00:12:40.467
Enough to know I want to do this.
Not so much that you should feel guilty.

00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:43.386
That's the perfect amount.

00:12:50.686 --> 00:12:52.437
- You know what's weird?
- What?

00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:55.064
- This doesn't feel weird.
- I know.

00:12:55.232 --> 00:12:58.777
- You're a really good kisser.
- Well, I have kissed over four women.

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:03.406
- Want to get under the covers?
- Mm-hm.

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:04.783
Okay.

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:15.752
Wow, you are really fast!

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.047
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

00:13:20.674 --> 00:13:23.092
- We're gonna see each other naked.
- Yep.

00:13:23.928 --> 00:13:26.471
- At the same time?
- Count of three?

00:13:26.722 --> 00:13:29.557
One, two, three.

00:13:34.313 --> 00:13:38.233
Well, I think it's safe to say
our friendship is effectively ruined.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.777
- Eh, we weren't that close anyway.
- Eh.

00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:45.865
Joey, Joey, Joey. It's Joey.

00:13:48.619 --> 00:13:49.661
Hey.

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.372
Hey, Joe. I was just watching a movie...

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:58.795
Oh, dude, I'm so sorry.

00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:01.548
No!

00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:04.175
It's cool, I'm still with my bridesmaid.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:05.969
Where are the condoms?

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:08.012
In my bag over there.

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:09.389
Ah.

00:14:13.853 --> 00:14:15.061
Uh...

00:14:15.229 --> 00:14:16.563
...could you leave me one?

00:14:19.859 --> 00:14:20.900
For just you?

00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:23.862
Yeah.

00:14:26.282 --> 00:14:29.534
All right. There you go, buddy.

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:31.661
Go nuts.

00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:36.124
That's what that was?

00:14:36.292 --> 00:14:38.710
Can you imagine
if I hadn't left you that last one?

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:41.254
You two might've never gotten together.

00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:44.924
Oh, ooh. Can you imagine if I had sent
that hooker up, like I was gonna?

00:14:46.927 --> 00:14:49.679
- It's like it was in the stars.
- Hmm.

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:51.347
Yeah, totally meant to be.

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:55.268
Tell him who you originally
wanted to hook up with that night.

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.854
- What?
- What?

00:14:58.355 --> 00:14:59.647
What?

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:04.402
Who did you originally
want to hook up with?

00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:08.156
Okay, fine, but please don't be upset.

00:15:08.365 --> 00:15:12.619
I was really depressed, okay?
And really drunk.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:17.332
I wanted something stupid
and meaningless. I just wanted sex.

00:15:17.833 --> 00:15:20.668
So when I went to your room that night...

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:24.255
...I was actually looking for Joey.

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:32.263
Yeah, baby.

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:36.225
No, baby.

00:15:37.561 --> 00:15:38.853
Oh, my God.

00:15:39.104 --> 00:15:40.897
You came looking for Joey?

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:45.443
- Were you planning on telling me this?
- No, I didn't think it was important.

00:15:46.278 --> 00:15:48.404
It's not important? It's not important?

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:51.783
If it wasn't for a bridesmaid,
you'd be marrying him.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:56.579
No! Do you know how unbelievably
glad I am that Joey wasn't there?

00:15:56.747 --> 00:15:58.331
Hey!

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:02.543
I'm a man of the cloth
but I still have feelings.

00:16:04.588 --> 00:16:07.757
There's no way you're doing
this wedding now, okay?

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:11.594
What? That's not fair. It's not my fault.

00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:13.388
I was with my bridesmaid.

00:16:13.597 --> 00:16:15.682
And who's to say I would've said yes?

00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:18.059
I mean, I would've said yes.

00:16:19.436 --> 00:16:22.355
Look, you are making way
too big a deal out of this.

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:24.232
Everything worked out okay.

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.817
It's just weird, okay?

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:30.029
I don't want to be saying my vows with
the mental image of you and Monica.

00:16:30.197 --> 00:16:33.449
I need... I don't know what I need.
I need a walk.

00:16:33.617 --> 00:16:37.161
- Wait, Chandler, it's not a big deal.
- It is to me.

00:16:37.371 --> 00:16:40.665
You wanted to sleep with Batman
and settled for Robin.

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:48.715
- This is crazy.
- No, Robin is so gay.

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:55.471
- So now what have we agreed?
- No more pranks.

00:16:55.639 --> 00:16:59.267
- What else?
- You and Daddy were not on a break.

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:00.560
Very good.

00:17:04.189 --> 00:17:07.066
Rachel, what are you doing here?

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:10.486
I'm just visiting my good friend Carol.

00:17:10.654 --> 00:17:13.406
- Your good friend?
- Yeah.

00:17:13.574 --> 00:17:15.241
What's her last name?

00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:19.120
Carol...

00:17:19.830 --> 00:17:21.456
...Lesbian.
- Nice.

00:17:24.668 --> 00:17:27.670
By the way, that, uh...
That line down my face...

00:17:28.213 --> 00:17:34.135
The line that prompted a student
in my last class of the day to say:

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:36.262
"Dude, don't you ever wash your face?"

00:17:38.432 --> 00:17:40.516
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.895
I don't want you teaching my son
that stuff anymore.

00:17:44.104 --> 00:17:45.938
- Okay?
- Fine. Fine.

00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:49.859
Once I taught him that stuff,
he called me "fun Aunt Rachel."

00:17:50.027 --> 00:17:52.111
And I loved being fun Aunt Rachel.

00:17:54.406 --> 00:17:56.741
I'm glad you guys were bonding but...

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.077
Look, he doesn't have any siblings.

00:17:59.328 --> 00:18:01.621
Somebody has to teach him this stuff.

00:18:01.872 --> 00:18:05.625
I haven't taught him anything
a normal 6-year-old doesn't know.

00:18:05.876 --> 00:18:07.919
- Crap!
- I gotta go.

00:18:14.093 --> 00:18:15.968
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.807
You want this scone? It came for me
but it would rather sleep with you.

00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.851
Nothing even happened.

00:18:25.312 --> 00:18:27.688
I just... I don't want you to be upset.

00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:29.649
How can I not be upset?

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.985
I finally fall in love
with this fantastic woman...

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:35.488
...and it turns out she wanted you first.

00:18:35.656 --> 00:18:38.574
Yeah, for like a half an hour one night.

00:18:39.076 --> 00:18:41.661
Chandler, she wants you
for the rest of her life.

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:47.208
We look at you and we see you together,
and it just...

00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:50.753
It fits, you know?

00:18:51.171 --> 00:18:54.590
And you just know
it's gonna last forever.

00:18:57.594 --> 00:18:59.512
That's what you should say.

00:19:01.056 --> 00:19:02.306
What?

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:07.186
When you're marrying us,
that's what you should say.

00:19:09.148 --> 00:19:10.982
Really? I could do it?

00:19:12.151 --> 00:19:13.484
I'd love you to do it.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:16.028
Hey.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.952
But those are the words.
Those exact words.

00:19:23.912 --> 00:19:26.414
Well, I don't remember exactly...

00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:33.171
...but it's pretty much about having
and giving and sharing and receiving.

00:19:38.218 --> 00:19:39.510
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:19:39.678 --> 00:19:42.763
- So you guys doing okay?
- Yeah.

00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:47.018
We talked and Monica made me see
that I overreacted a little bit.

00:19:47.186 --> 00:19:51.480
- Some things are more important.
- Yeah, baby.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:57.486
I'm really glad you guys are okay,
but I just keep thinking...

00:19:57.738 --> 00:20:00.907
...what would've happened
if you two had hooked up.

00:20:03.994 --> 00:20:05.828
Honey, dinner's ready!

00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:14.253
What's my little chef got for me tonight?

00:20:14.421 --> 00:20:16.797
- Your favorite.
- Ho, ho, ho.

00:20:16.965 --> 00:20:18.674
Fried stuff with cheese.

00:20:19.218 --> 00:20:20.259
Yep.

00:20:20.427 --> 00:20:21.969
And lots of it!

00:20:23.472 --> 00:20:24.847
Thanks, sweetheart.

00:20:25.265 --> 00:20:27.975
Give me a little sugar. Okay.

00:20:29.353 --> 00:20:30.478
You wanna go...?

00:20:30.646 --> 00:20:32.980
Here we go, here we go, here we go.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.111
How you doing?

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:47.203
- Hey.
- Hey!

00:20:47.454 --> 00:20:52.083
I'm sorry to do this again,
but could you look after Ben for a bit?

00:20:52.292 --> 00:20:53.960
I've got this meeting at school...

00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:57.088
...and he asked for his "fun Aunt Rachel."

00:20:57.714 --> 00:21:00.091
Well, of course I will watch him.

00:21:00.342 --> 00:21:02.301
We have fun, don't we, Ben?

00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:06.681
- Okay. See you later, pal.
- Okay.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:10.977
Wait a minute. Ben, I can't do it.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.854
- You got something on your back.
- What?

00:21:15.357 --> 00:21:17.191
That's great. That is great.

00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:19.819
What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.947
"What did we just finish
talking about, Ben?"

00:21:23.657 --> 00:21:25.241
That's it! Come here!

00:21:25.492 --> 00:21:28.035
- You're in big trouble, young man!
- No, wait.

00:21:28.287 --> 00:21:30.413
Ben, come here! I am not kidding!

00:21:30.664 --> 00:21:31.914
You guys, hold it. Seriously...

00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:34.583
Oh, my God!
