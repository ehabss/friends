WEBVTT

00:00:03.378 --> 00:00:06.422
- Hey. Who wants French toast?
- Oh, I'll have some.

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.758
Me too. Eggs and milk in the fridge.
Thanks.

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:11.760
Ow.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.430
- Oh, what's the matter, honey?
- My hand feels weird.

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:16.557
I guess it's because I'm engaged.

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:21.020
- When will that start getting annoying?
- Start?

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.606
So let's actually get started
on the wedding plans.

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:25.941
- Okay.
- Already?

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:28.777
Yeah, we got a lot to do.
We gotta think about the flowers...

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:30.362
...the caterers, the music...

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.407
- Oh, I got some thoughts on the music...
- Chandler, too many cooks...

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:39.413
Take it from me. All you have to do
is show up and try to say the right name.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:43.709
Okay.

00:00:43.877 --> 00:00:47.171
- What in God's name is that?
- Oh, my God, the wedding book?

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:49.798
I haven't seen that since the 4th grade.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:55.137
This baby has everything.
Take, you know, locations for instance:

00:00:55.346 --> 00:00:59.099
First organized alphabetically,
then geographically...

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.643
...then by square footage.

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:05.606
That is so smart. Ha.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:08.275
Break it off. Ahem. Break it off, now.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.901
And that should conclusively prove...

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.905
...that I had the idea
for Jurassic Park first.

00:01:55.198 --> 00:01:57.032
- Now, let's take a look...
- Hey, Ross.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.451
Phoebe, oh, my God,
what are you doing here?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.122
I need to talk to you. It's pretty urgent.
It's about Monica and Chandler.

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:05.541
Oh, my God. Um, of course.

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:08.335
Uh, would you please excuse me
for a moment?

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:12.589
Um, heh, do you know each other's
hometowns? Why don't you?

00:02:13.508 --> 00:02:14.925
What's going on?

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:19.721
Well, um, not much. I was just thinking
that since those guys just got engaged...

00:02:20.014 --> 00:02:22.224
...that maybe it'd be nice
if they had some privacy.

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:26.103
So could I just move in with you
for a couple days?

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:28.897
Um...

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:32.734
Okay, yeah, sure. But what's wrong
with Monica and Chandler?

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:35.154
Nothing. Why?

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:38.907
Phoebe, you said it was urgent.

00:02:39.117 --> 00:02:42.286
Oh, yeah, it is. I'm going to the movies
and it starts in like five minutes.

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:49.626
Do you realize I have a classroom
full of students?

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:55.591
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so rude.
Does anyone want to come to the movies?

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:01.930
I haven't cleared the
budget with my parents yet...

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:03.724
...but tell me how this is for music.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:08.103
All right, um, a string quartet for the
processional, a jazz trio for cocktails...

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:10.606
...the Bay City Rollers
for dancing...

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:12.733
Wait, that was
for my 6th grade wedding.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:18.572
Well, you couldn't get them anyway.
Ian doesn't play anymore, and Derek...

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:22.993
Well, Derek is a name I shouldn't know.

00:03:23.786 --> 00:03:27.873
Hey, Mon, do you have another pillow,
you know, something a little snugglier?

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.293
Why are you napping over here
instead of over at your place?

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:33.587
- The duck.
- What, the duck?

00:03:33.796 --> 00:03:36.131
What the hell
did the damn duck do now?

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:41.470
Uh, well, he did not get sick
somewhere in there...

00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:44.973
...and it was immediately found
and properly cleaned up.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:47.893
Now, do I get to look at this book...

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:51.355
...or is it just for people who are actually
involved in the wedding?

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.816
Of course you can look at it.
Yeah, I want your opinion too.

00:03:54.984 --> 00:03:56.652
- Okay.
- Here you go.

00:03:56.861 --> 00:03:59.404
- What do you think about centerpieces?
- Centerpieces.

00:03:59.656 --> 00:04:02.658
- Roses or lilies?
- Definitely roses.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:10.332
Well, I just think they're a bit more
wedding-y, you know.

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:16.004
- But lilies are the clear choice.
- Oh, my God, it's like one mind.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:17.673
Uh-huh.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.927
Guys, guys, you gotta let me nap.

00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.680
I'm gonna get cranky.

00:04:25.556 --> 00:04:29.059
Joey, there is a perfectly good couch
across the hall.

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.561
Yes, it is perfectly good...

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:35.274
...and it is not one of the places
the duck got sick.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:37.359
What?

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:41.863
- All right, I'm gonna go.
- Joey, what did the duck do?

00:04:42.156 --> 00:04:45.075
I don't know,
but he did not eat your face cream.

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:57.921
Hey, little buddy.

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:01.258
How you feeling? Aah.

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:06.179
What the hell is in that face cream?

00:05:19.777 --> 00:05:21.987
That's so soft.

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:26.783
Pillowcases.

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:31.913
Oh, ah.

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:46.303
"Zelda looked at the chimney
sweep. Her father, the vicar..."

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:47.846
Vicar?

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.433
"...wouldn't be home for hours.

00:05:51.642 --> 00:05:53.602
Her loins were burning.

00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:58.023
She threw caution to the wind
and reached out and grabbed his..."

00:05:58.191 --> 00:06:02.944
Whoa.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.781
This is a dirty book.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:21.463
Uh, Phoebe?

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.298
Oh, Ross, hi.

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:29.805
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, I'm with a client right now.

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:34.267
- Phoebe.
- Okay, let's talk outside.

00:06:35.478 --> 00:06:38.480
Phoebe, you can't massage people
in my apartment.

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:41.191
What's the big deal?
I did it at Monica and Chandler's.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.068
And they knew about it?

00:06:46.864 --> 00:06:49.408
Okay, look, Ross,
what is this really about?

00:06:50.034 --> 00:06:53.870
Look, this is my home, and I want to
be able to come and go whenever I want.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.499
Okay. I will find someplace else
to do the rest of my appointments.

00:06:57.792 --> 00:06:59.501
I just don't know what the big deal is.

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:02.671
The big deal is I don't want naked,
greasy strangers in my apartment...

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:07.175
...when I want to kick back with a puzzle...
Beer, cold beer.

00:07:10.054 --> 00:07:12.055
Hey, Joey. What are you doing?

00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:16.309
Sweeping. Why? Does it turn you on?

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:19.688
No.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:21.690
Hmm.

00:07:22.066 --> 00:07:25.068
What if I was, uh, sweeping a chimney?

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.322
Joey, did you eat my face cream?

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:35.454
Where are you going?
The vicar won't be home for hours.

00:07:41.377 --> 00:07:42.878
Joey...

00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:45.380
...where did you learn that word?

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:49.718
Where do you think...

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:51.386
...Zelda?

00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:57.601
- You found my book?
- Yeah, I did.

00:07:58.561 --> 00:08:01.605
Joey, what are you doing
going into my bedroom?

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.732
Okay, I'm sorry.
I went in there to take a nap.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.734
And I know I shouldn't have,
but you got porn.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.444
Ugh.

00:08:07.612 --> 00:08:10.906
You know what? I don't care.
I'm not ashamed of my book.

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:15.952
There's nothing wrong with a woman
enjoying a little erotica.

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:20.081
It's just a healthy expression
of female sexuality...

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:24.294
...which, by the way, is something
that you will never understand.

00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:28.465
You got porn.

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:54.115
- Hello.
- Hi, is, uh, Phoebe here?

00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:58.286
- Uh, no, no, she's out for the night.
- Oh, great.

00:08:58.663 --> 00:09:01.456
Heh. Can I help you with something?

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.667
I don't know. Are you a masseur?

00:09:04.418 --> 00:09:05.794
Yes, I am.

00:09:07.797 --> 00:09:10.173
Great. Dad?

00:09:15.721 --> 00:09:19.140
Thank you so much.
I'll be back to pick him up in an hour.

00:09:26.023 --> 00:09:28.066
So, Chandler, your parents
must've been thrilled...

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:29.734
...when you told them
you were engaged.

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:32.195
Oh, yeah.
I should probably call them.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:35.490
I remember when we first got engaged.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.867
- I don't think I've heard that story.
- Dad, you don't...

00:09:38.077 --> 00:09:40.328
Well, I'd gotten Judy pregnant.

00:09:42.623 --> 00:09:43.999
I still don't know how.

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:48.503
You don't know how? Your dog
thought my diaphragm was a chew toy.

00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:53.258
What a sweet story.

00:09:54.343 --> 00:09:57.220
At least you're not hearing it
at your 5th grade Halloween party.

00:09:57.471 --> 00:09:59.097
What? They wanted a scary story.

00:10:00.725 --> 00:10:03.101
Anyway, we're really excited
about our wedding plans.

00:10:03.352 --> 00:10:06.980
Pretty soon we'll be making a big
withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund.

00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:14.904
- What?
- You tell her, Jack. I can't do it.

00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:17.699
What happened?
You still have the wedding fund, don't you?

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:21.119
We have it.
Only now we call it "the beach house."

00:10:25.207 --> 00:10:28.168
I can't believe you spent my wedding fund
on the beach house.

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.711
We're sorry. We assumed...

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.839
...if you got married after you turned 30
you'd pay for it yourself.

00:10:33.007 --> 00:10:35.675
You bought the beach house
when I was 23.

00:10:35.843 --> 00:10:38.178
Which means you had seven years
of beach fun...

00:10:38.346 --> 00:10:40.430
...and you can't put a price on that,
sweetie.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:44.934
We really do feel bad about this though.

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.228
We started saving again
when you dated Richard.

00:10:47.396 --> 00:10:49.898
But then that went to hell,
so we redid the kitchen.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.277
What about when I started
dating Chandler?

00:10:54.445 --> 00:10:56.780
It was Chandler.
We didn't think he'd ever propose.

00:10:58.366 --> 00:11:02.577
Clearly I did not start drinking enough
at the start of the meal. Heh.

00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:04.871
I can't believe there is no money
for my wedding.

00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:08.083
We might still have some
if your father hadn't thought...

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.085
...to sell ice over the Internet.

00:11:10.294 --> 00:11:13.963
- It seemed like such a simple idea.
- Stupid, Jack. The word is stupid.

00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:17.425
All right, enough.
I don't want to hear about it anymore.

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:19.094
Good luck, Chandler.

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:47.622
Okay, now I'm going to...

00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:50.542
...touch you.

00:12:00.219 --> 00:12:02.178
Oh, that's soft.

00:12:28.164 --> 00:12:30.999
I can't believe this. Do you think
your parents could help pay for it?

00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:32.333
I don't know.

00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:36.671
My mother spent most of her money
on her fourth wedding.

00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:39.215
She's saving the rest for her divorce.

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:44.220
And any extra cash my father has,
he saves for his yearly trips to...

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:46.347
...Dollywood.

00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:49.934
What happened at dinner?

00:12:50.102 --> 00:12:52.228
My parents spent the money
for our wedding.

00:12:53.647 --> 00:12:55.607
My God, what did you order?

00:12:57.026 --> 00:13:01.738
Wait, there's no money?
Well, this is terrible.

00:13:01.989 --> 00:13:05.492
You guys are gonna have to get married
in, like, a rec center.

00:13:06.702 --> 00:13:10.663
- Honey, it's gonna be okay.
- No, it's not gonna be okay. It sucks.

00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:14.709
- No swing band, no lilies.
- No, you know what? It's gonna be okay.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.712
I mean, you don't need to have this...

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.799
...rustic Italian feast, you know?

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:27.514
And you don't need this custom-made
empire-waisted, duchess satin gown.

00:13:27.723 --> 00:13:29.432
You can wear off-the-rack.

00:13:34.897 --> 00:13:36.439
Look, it really is gonna be okay.

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:40.819
The important thing is that we love
each other and we're gonna get married.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:44.739
Do you even understand
what "off-the-rack" means?

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.576
Why don't you just pay for it yourself?

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:50.286
How? I don't have any money.

00:13:50.538 --> 00:13:52.539
- Well, I have some.
- How much?

00:13:52.748 --> 00:13:53.790
Well, close to...

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:08.638
- Whoa! Are you kidding me?
- What? How much?

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:11.766
- It's enough for wedding scenario A.
- Really?

00:14:11.934 --> 00:14:14.853
How great are you, you little saver? Heh.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:17.939
The amount you have is exactly
the budget of my dream wedding.

00:14:18.107 --> 00:14:21.067
Oh, you guys
are so made for each other.

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:25.446
Well, you're not suggesting we spend
all of the money on the wedding?

00:14:25.614 --> 00:14:27.448
Uh, yeah.

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:32.662
Look, Mon, I've been saving this money
for six years...

00:14:32.872 --> 00:14:37.125
...and I kind of have some of it earmarked
for the future, not just for a party.

00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:41.337
Wow. Hello, Mr. Chandler.

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:47.302
Sweetie, this is the most special day
of our lives.

00:14:47.469 --> 00:14:51.389
I realize that, honey, but I'm not gonna
spend all the money on one party.

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.058
Honey, um, I love you. Heh.

00:14:54.226 --> 00:14:57.520
But, um, if you call our wedding a party
one more time...

00:14:57.813 --> 00:14:59.355
...you may not get invited.

00:15:02.109 --> 00:15:06.112
We can always earn more money, okay?
But we're only gonna get married once.

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:10.742
Look, I understand, but I have to put
my foot down, okay? The answer is no.

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:14.162
You're gonna have
to put your foot down?

00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:16.664
Yes, I am.

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.836
Wow. Money and a firm hand.

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:24.672
Finally a Chandler
I can get on board with.

00:15:33.223 --> 00:15:35.683
- Hey, Rach.
- Joey.

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:40.188
Hey, Rach, do you smell smoke?

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:44.651
Uh-huh. I get it. Smoke, chimney,
chimney sweep. Very funny. Ha, ha.

00:15:45.361 --> 00:15:48.780
No, no, no, I'm serious.
You don't smell it?

00:15:49.573 --> 00:15:50.698
Something's on fire.

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:52.867
No, I don't smell anything.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:56.788
Oh, you know what?
It's probably just your burning loins.

00:16:01.543 --> 00:16:04.545
- Hey, what are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:10.051
Mm, damn, this coffee's cold.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.470
Hey, Rach, do you mind
if I heat this up on your loins?

00:16:16.475 --> 00:16:20.269
You know, I cannot believe
you told him. Joey...

00:16:20.688 --> 00:16:23.898
So I guess you bought that book
after we broke up, huh?

00:16:24.108 --> 00:16:27.735
Uh-huh, I did, because I wore out
my first copy when I was with you.

00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:30.238
Oh, yeah? Yeah?

00:16:30.406 --> 00:16:34.701
Well, uh, when we were going out,
I read tons of porno magazines.

00:16:35.744 --> 00:16:36.953
'Sup?

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:42.417
Ross, how could you do that
to an old man?

00:16:44.962 --> 00:16:46.754
Excuse me, ladies.

00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:49.257
I'm sorry?

00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:51.843
My massage client, Arthur.

00:16:52.094 --> 00:16:54.762
His daughter called and said
some guy that worked for me...

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:57.098
...gave him a really weird massage
this afternoon.

00:16:57.307 --> 00:17:00.226
I gave him an extremely
professional massage.

00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:03.813
He said you poked
at him with wooden spoons.

00:17:04.023 --> 00:17:06.774
Okay, so it wasn't
a traditional massage.

00:17:07.026 --> 00:17:10.111
But I did give him acupressure
with a pair of chopsticks...

00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:14.532
...and I gently exfoliated him
with a mop.

00:17:16.785 --> 00:17:20.538
Well, he's never coming back, okay?
You just cost me $80 a week.

00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:24.000
You know what? This is your fault.
You didn't move his appointment.

00:17:24.293 --> 00:17:27.253
Oh, it's my fault?
You didn't have to massage him.

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:28.755
You could've sent him away.

00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:31.674
You could've not rolled Tonka trucks
up and down his back.

00:17:33.343 --> 00:17:35.970
He said he liked that.

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:41.392
You're right, you're right.
I'm sorry.

00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:44.979
Dude, what are you massaging
an old man for?

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.525
- His daughter was hot.
- Gotcha.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.993
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:01.287
Listen, um...

00:18:02.706 --> 00:18:04.165
...I've been thinking.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:09.337
And it's not fair for me to ask you
to spend all your money on our wedding.

00:18:09.546 --> 00:18:12.507
I mean, you work really hard for that.

00:18:12.841 --> 00:18:14.926
- Well.
- Well, you work for that.

00:18:17.012 --> 00:18:18.596
Look, I thought about it too.

00:18:18.764 --> 00:18:24.352
And I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

00:18:25.354 --> 00:18:29.190
- You do?
- Yeah, I'm putting my foot down.

00:18:31.026 --> 00:18:33.986
Yeah, look, when I proposed, I told you...

00:18:34.154 --> 00:18:37.365
...that I would do anything
to make you happy.

00:18:37.616 --> 00:18:40.952
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy...

00:18:41.203 --> 00:18:43.329
...then that's what we're gonna do.

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:46.124
You are so sweet.

00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:50.086
Oh, but wait.

00:18:50.587 --> 00:18:53.214
What about our...?
What about the future and stuff?

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:55.716
Ah, forget about the future and stuff.

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:57.343
So we only have two kids.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:19:01.389
You know, we'll pick our favorite
and that one will get to go to college.

00:19:02.391 --> 00:19:05.059
- Have you thought about that?
- Yeah.

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:06.936
How many kids were we gonna have?

00:19:07.104 --> 00:19:10.857
Uh, four. A boy, twin girls
and another boy.

00:19:12.609 --> 00:19:14.652
What else did you think about?

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.655
Well, heh, stuff like where we'd live,
you know.

00:19:17.906 --> 00:19:20.575
Like a small place outside the city...

00:19:20.742 --> 00:19:23.995
...where our kids could learn
to ride their bikes and stuff.

00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:27.081
We could have a cat that had a bell
on its collar...

00:19:27.374 --> 00:19:31.878
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

00:19:32.087 --> 00:19:36.132
Of course we'd have an apartment
over the garage where Joey could grow old.

00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:42.889
You know what?

00:19:44.099 --> 00:19:46.767
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:49.312
- Sure you do.
- No.

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:55.610
I want everything that you've just said.
I want a marriage.

00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:59.113
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:04.118
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:13.127
Hey, listen, when you were talking
about our future, you said cat.

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.838
But you meant dog, right? Ha, ha.

00:20:18.175 --> 00:20:20.635
- Ha, yeah, totally.
- Oh, good.

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:34.065
Hello, Zelda.

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:39.278
- Who are you supposed to be?
- The vicar.

00:20:40.072 --> 00:20:44.116
- Do you even know what a vicar is?
- Like a goalie, right?

00:20:44.701 --> 00:20:45.743
Yeah.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:47.870
Look, Joey, it's enough, all right?

00:20:48.121 --> 00:20:51.123
You keep making these stupid jokes
and these sleazy innuendoes...

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:53.209
...and it's just not funny anymore.

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:56.712
All right, I'm sorry. Rach, I'm sorry.
Okay? I'm sorry.

00:20:56.922 --> 00:21:01.217
Maybe I could make it up to you
by taking you roughly in the barn.

00:21:01.385 --> 00:21:02.885
Ugh.

00:21:03.845 --> 00:21:07.265
All right, you know what? That's it.
You want to do it? Let's do it.

00:21:08.183 --> 00:21:09.392
Huh?

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:12.186
That's right.
I want to do it with you.

00:21:13.981 --> 00:21:18.651
Been trying to fight it,
but you just said all the right things.

00:21:18.902 --> 00:21:20.278
Uh, I did?

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:23.698
Yeah, oh, I've been waiting so long
to get on that body.

00:21:24.741 --> 00:21:27.159
- This body?
- Yeah, that's right.

00:21:27.411 --> 00:21:29.453
Come on, Joey, sex me up.

00:21:29.663 --> 00:21:33.332
Hey, you're starting to sound like
the butcher's wife there in chapter seven.

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:37.837
Oh, come on, now. Don't keep me waiting.
Get those clothes off.

00:21:38.046 --> 00:21:42.300
But I would keep that helmet on,
because you're in for a rough ride.

00:21:43.468 --> 00:21:45.303
I don't want to. I'm scared.
