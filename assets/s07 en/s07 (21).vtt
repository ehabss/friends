WEBVTT

00:00:03.878 --> 00:00:07.423
Do you realize we're
getting married in four weeks?

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.676
Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!

00:00:11.261 --> 00:00:13.595
You realize you get louder each week?

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:18.142
There's still so much to do!
Have you written your vows?

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:22.896
I figured I'd just buy those.
"Pat, I'd like to buy a vow." Ha, ha.

00:00:23.565 --> 00:00:27.026
You know I've no sense of humor
when it comes to this.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:33.323
- Right. Have you written yours yet?
- No, but I know what I'm gonna say.

00:00:34.325 --> 00:00:36.702
Do you happen to know
what I'm gonna say?

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:41.665
Let's do it now. It won't be hard.

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.876
Say what's in your heart.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.303
Look at her go.
She must love me more than I love her!

00:00:54.929 --> 00:00:59.099
What's wrong with me?
Ooh, don't open that door.

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:45.312
Phew. "Monica, there are no words..."

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:51.276
There are no words!
This shouldn't be this hard!

00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:56.365
Uh... Oh! You've done this before.
What did you say in your vows?

00:01:56.533 --> 00:02:00.869
With Carol I promised never
to love another woman until I die.

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.996
She made no such promise.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:08.460
I'm pathetic. Monica knows what
to say, you should have seen her.

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:12.965
What's the emergency?

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:17.177
You have to help me write my vows.
All I have is this.

00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:21.306
I like the pretty drawing
of you in the wedding dress.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:26.353
- Thank you.
- Except your breasts look small.

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:29.523
Those are my eyes!

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:35.070
- Those are my breasts.
- Oh, yeah.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.658
Why don't you start
with something simple?

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.118
Like, um:

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:46.540
"Monica, from the moment I met you
I knew I loved you."

00:02:46.708 --> 00:02:48.500
I can't do that.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:51.211
Everyone, this is Chandler.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.505
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.133
Okay.

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:01.513
Okay, okay.
Um, maybe you could start with:

00:03:01.681 --> 00:03:04.391
"Chandler, even though
we were friends...

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:08.145
...there was a part of me
that knew I wanted more."

00:03:08.313 --> 00:03:13.108
All right, there's a nuclear
holocaust. I'm the last man on Earth.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:14.651
Would you go out with me?

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.868
Ooh! Are we allowed
to lie in the vows?

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:28.749
Okay, don't talk about those feelings.
Just say something about...

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:31.877
...all the things
he's taught you, like...

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:40.344
Or all the things you taught him.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:45.265
Everybody knows the erogenous zones.
One, two, three...

00:03:45.808 --> 00:03:50.687
...four, five, six and seven.

00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.689
There are seven?

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.946
- That's one?
- Heh, heh. Kind of an important one.

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.032
I was looking at it upside down.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.496
Ha. You know, sometimes that helps.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:15.254
Okay, start out with a little one...

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.298
...a two, a one-two-three...

00:04:19.342 --> 00:04:22.719
...a three, a five...

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:26.431
...a four, a three-two...

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.809
...two, a two-four-six.

00:04:29.727 --> 00:04:33.480
Two-four-six, four, two...

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:36.316
...two, four-seven...

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:40.028
...five-seven, six-seven...

00:04:40.238 --> 00:04:42.781
...seven, seven...

00:04:43.032 --> 00:04:46.326
...seven, seven, seven...

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:47.953
...seven!

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:49.997
Seven.

00:04:56.045 --> 00:04:58.755
Oh! I got it.
How about something like:

00:04:58.923 --> 00:05:03.885
"Monica, when I look back
over our time together..."

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:10.517
- Yeah?
- I can't do all of it.

00:05:10.768 --> 00:05:12.477
Look back over your time together.

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.524
Oh, look, twins!

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:21.737
No fair! I don't even have one,
how come they get two?

00:05:21.904 --> 00:05:24.656
- You'll get one.
- Yeah, when?

00:05:24.824 --> 00:05:26.283
All right, I'll tell you what.

00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:28.869
When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:33.874
...what do you say we have one?
- Why wouldn't I be married?

00:05:35.043 --> 00:05:37.210
Oh, no, no, no.
I just meant hypothetically.

00:05:37.378 --> 00:05:40.464
Hypothetically,
why won't I be married?

00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:41.757
No, no.

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:45.552
What is it? Is there
something unmarriable about me?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.889
- Uh... Uh...
- Well?

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:52.392
Dear God, this parachute
is a knapsack!

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.146
I'm getting married today!

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.360
Think he knew I was here?

00:06:08.576 --> 00:06:09.993
Nice try.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:11.995
Wait, wait, wait.

00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:16.166
- Look, Monica...
- Ah!

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.091
- This is not gonna work.
- I bet this'll work.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.143
You are so great! I love you.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:46.279
What?

00:06:46.447 --> 00:06:50.283
I said you're so great,
and then I stopped talking.

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:55.580
- You said you love me!
- No, I didn't.

00:06:57.458 --> 00:06:59.835
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't!

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.463
- You love me!
- No, I don't!

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:05.424
Stop it! Stop it!

00:07:09.679 --> 00:07:13.723
You know, I was thinking,
what if I, uh, unpack here?

00:07:13.933 --> 00:07:15.684
Then all your stuff would be here.

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.354
Well...

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:23.733
What if it was here?

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.487
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

00:07:28.072 --> 00:07:29.573
Doesn't make any sense.

00:07:30.074 --> 00:07:31.658
Okay.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.164
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:48.717
We wanted to surprise you.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:00.687
Oh, my God!

00:08:07.195 --> 00:08:08.778
Chandler...

00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:11.907
...in all my life...

00:08:12.783 --> 00:08:15.452
...I never thought I'd be so lucky...

00:08:18.956 --> 00:08:22.584
...as to fall in love with my best...

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:28.131
My best... There's a reason
why girls don't do this!

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:30.425
Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.386
I thought...

00:08:37.683 --> 00:08:39.184
I can do this.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:44.648
I thought...

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:50.070
...that it mattered what I said
or where I said it.

00:08:50.696 --> 00:08:55.909
Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you...

00:08:59.747 --> 00:09:04.251
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.548
And if you let me...

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:14.052
...I'll spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

00:09:23.104 --> 00:09:24.604
Monica?

00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.066
Will you marry me?

00:09:30.278 --> 00:09:31.987
Yes.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:47.586
Can we come in?
We're dying out here!

00:09:48.754 --> 00:09:50.338
Come in! Come in!

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:53.258
- We're engaged!
- Yes!

00:10:04.937 --> 00:10:06.438
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:10:06.606 --> 00:10:08.189
- Hi.
- What have you guys been up to?

00:10:08.357 --> 00:10:11.735
Uh, helping Chandler write his vows.
He kicked us out.

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:14.696
Joey kept making
inappropriate suggestions.

00:10:16.699 --> 00:10:20.577
How is "Monica, I love
your sweet ass" inappropriate?

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.080
How's Monica doing?

00:10:24.248 --> 00:10:28.168
Lucky she's got a sweet ass.
She's not so good at writing.

00:10:29.587 --> 00:10:32.380
In four weeks
they're gonna be married!

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.758
Let's just hope it works.

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.177
Nine out of 10 marriages
end in divorce.

00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:39.596
Heh. That's not true.

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:41.848
You're right. How's the missus?

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:44.768
I can't believe...

00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:47.437
...they're together 3 years.
- That long?

00:10:47.605 --> 00:10:51.066
It seems like less
because they hid it from us.

00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:54.778
Hey, it's me. Coming in.

00:11:01.327 --> 00:11:03.953
I've had a very long, hard day.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:08.208
- Uh, I'm getting chicken. Want some?
- Uh, no. Bye, then.

00:11:13.047 --> 00:11:14.297
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:17.676
He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking if I wanted chicken.

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.219
Chicken?

00:11:20.388 --> 00:11:22.097
I could eat some chicken.

00:11:23.557 --> 00:11:25.016
Hey, Joe!

00:11:27.645 --> 00:11:31.147
Can I get a, uh, three-piece,
uh, coleslaw, beans and a Coke?

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.983
Diet Coke.

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:42.325
- Why didn't they tell us?
- I know, we were cool about it.

00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:45.453
You? And you?

00:11:46.372 --> 00:11:48.748
You cannot tell. No one knows.

00:11:48.916 --> 00:11:50.792
How? When?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.586
- It happened in London.
- In London?

00:11:56.507 --> 00:12:00.135
We didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:02.554
But it is a big deal!

00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:05.473
- I have to tell someone.
- No, no!

00:12:05.933 --> 00:12:07.976
- You can't.
- Please!

00:12:08.144 --> 00:12:12.564
We don't want to deal with telling
them. Just promise you won't tell.

00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.485
All right!

00:12:18.195 --> 00:12:20.196
I can't wait to be with you.

00:12:20.364 --> 00:12:22.490
I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry.

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:25.702
Laundry, huh? Is that my new nickname?

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:29.497
Aw.

00:12:30.374 --> 00:12:32.208
You know your nickname, Mr. Big...

00:12:34.628 --> 00:12:39.716
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:52.604
Chandler and Monica!

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.272
Oh, my God!

00:12:54.523 --> 00:12:57.400
- Aah! Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

00:12:57.693 --> 00:13:01.279
- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
- Phoebe! Phoebe!

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:05.158
- It's okay! It's okay!
- No! They're doing it!

00:13:05.326 --> 00:13:06.576
I know! I know!

00:13:06.827 --> 00:13:08.077
- You know?
- Yes!

00:13:08.287 --> 00:13:11.456
And Joey, but Ross doesn't,
so stop screaming!

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:13.082
Hey, what's going on?

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:17.462
What? What?

00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:20.715
We're excited that you
might get this place!

00:13:21.258 --> 00:13:24.636
- Actually, it looks really good.
- It looks pretty good!

00:13:26.013 --> 00:13:27.430
Get in here! Come on!

00:13:31.393 --> 00:13:33.895
So they don't know
that Rachel knows?

00:13:35.105 --> 00:13:38.066
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:41.528
Enough of us know.
We can just tell them we know.

00:13:41.695 --> 00:13:44.697
The lying and the secrets
will be over.

00:13:44.865 --> 00:13:49.536
Or, we can not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

00:13:50.329 --> 00:13:53.414
We better go if we're gonna
catch that movie.

00:13:53.624 --> 00:13:55.375
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:58.253
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:06.427
Did you see
the inappropriate pinching?

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:07.762
Actually, I did.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:11.391
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:15.603
Oh, my God!
My God, she knows about us!

00:14:15.771 --> 00:14:19.232
- Phoebe knows about us!
- I didn't tell them.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.318
Them? Who's them?

00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:26.114
Uh, Phoebe and Joey.

00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:29.200
Joey!

00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:30.827
And Rachel.

00:14:31.245 --> 00:14:34.038
They made me promise not to tell.

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:37.667
They think they are so slick,
messing with us!

00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:41.004
They don't know that we know
that they know.

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:44.340
- So...
- Ah, yes!

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:47.468
The messers become the messees!

00:14:48.554 --> 00:14:52.056
My God, he wants me to come
over and feel his biceps!

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:54.309
- Are you kidding?
- No.

00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:57.061
I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...

00:15:05.988 --> 00:15:08.573
Joey? Do they know that we know?

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:11.284
- No.
- Joey!

00:15:11.493 --> 00:15:14.162
- They know you know.
- Ugh! I knew it!

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:17.248
I cannot believe those two!

00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:20.209
They thought that they could
mess with us? With us?

00:15:23.547 --> 00:15:27.008
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:30.261
Joey, you can't say anything.

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:32.388
Couldn't if I wanted to.

00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:36.100
This is totally getting out of hand.

00:15:36.268 --> 00:15:38.978
- She wants me to put lotion on her!
- She's bluffing!

00:15:39.188 --> 00:15:42.106
She's not backing down.
She went like this.

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:47.403
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.283
Oh, man.
Aren't you guys done yet?

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:57.080
The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over.

00:15:57.247 --> 00:15:59.207
- Ooh, I like that.
- Okay.

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:04.295
Okay, show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.222
Wow! You didn't rip off
any buttons.

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:16.057
It's not my first time.

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:20.937
You go seduce her until she cracks.

00:16:21.188 --> 00:16:22.981
Okay, give me a second.

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:26.734
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

00:16:32.616 --> 00:16:33.866
Oh, you're, uh, going?

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:36.327
Um, not without you, lover.

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:44.544
So, this is my bra.

00:16:48.215 --> 00:16:50.299
It's very, very nice.

00:16:52.469 --> 00:16:55.013
Well, come here.

00:16:55.222 --> 00:16:57.890
I'm happy we're gonna
have all the sex.

00:16:59.435 --> 00:17:02.895
You should be. Heh. I'm very bendy.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:11.070
- I'm gonna kiss you.
- Not if I kiss you first.

00:17:31.341 --> 00:17:34.260
There's nothing left
for us to do but kiss.

00:17:35.137 --> 00:17:37.013
Here it comes.

00:17:38.098 --> 00:17:39.599
Our first kiss.

00:17:48.692 --> 00:17:52.028
- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!
- Ha!

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:54.030
- I can't have sex.
- Why not?

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.991
- I'm in love with Monica.
- You're what?

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:04.540
Love her! That's right, I love her!
I love her!

00:18:09.213 --> 00:18:11.005
I love you, Monica.

00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:14.133
I love you too, Chandler.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.433
I thought you guys were doing it,
I didn't know you were in love.

00:18:25.104 --> 00:18:27.647
That's it, it's over.
Everybody knows.

00:18:27.856 --> 00:18:31.901
- Well, Ross doesn't.
- We'd like it if no one told him yet.

00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:33.528
No.

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:38.116
What are you doing?

00:18:38.826 --> 00:18:42.787
Get off my sister!

00:18:43.705 --> 00:18:47.333
Friends getting married,
it's gotta change things.

00:18:47.584 --> 00:18:49.210
Think it'll be different?

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:52.505
How can it not be?
They're gonna have kids...

00:18:52.756 --> 00:18:56.092
...and hang out with other couples
who have kids.

00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:58.845
And maybe they'll leave the city...

00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:01.889
...to be near a Volvo dealership.

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:06.352
Things change.

00:19:06.562 --> 00:19:09.814
I don't want them
to move to a Volvo dealership.

00:19:11.441 --> 00:19:13.442
It'll be okay, Joe. Heh.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:17.155
Sorry. I just...
I like things the way they are.

00:19:17.823 --> 00:19:19.866
Who's this little naked guy?

00:19:20.117 --> 00:19:22.160
Uh, that naked guy would be me.

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:25.454
- Ha, aw, look at the little thing.
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:19:25.706 --> 00:19:27.123
Yes.

00:19:28.375 --> 00:19:32.712
Yes, fine, that is my penis.
Can we be grownups now?

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:36.799
- Who are those people?
- Got me.

00:19:37.009 --> 00:19:39.093
Oh, that's Nana right there.

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:41.929
- Wow.
- Let's see.

00:19:42.139 --> 00:19:44.807
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:48.561
Wow. Monica, you look like
your grandma. How old was she?

00:19:49.104 --> 00:19:50.688
Let's see, 1939.

00:19:50.898 --> 00:19:52.982
Yeah, uh, 24, 25.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:56.110
Huh. Looks like a fun gang.

00:20:01.575 --> 00:20:04.785
Ooh! Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked.

00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:05.995
Let me see.

00:20:08.999 --> 00:20:10.917
No, that would be me again.

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:17.506
Hey, you guys.

00:20:17.674 --> 00:20:18.716
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:20:18.884 --> 00:20:21.969
- What's going on?
- Well, we were just talking about...

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:25.431
...you guys getting married
and how great it is.

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:29.685
Yeah, you can get a Volvo.
If that's what you really want.

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:32.355
- That's so sweet.
- Hmm.

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:37.485
- So, we both finished our vows.
- Can we read them?

00:20:37.694 --> 00:20:40.655
As long as I don't hear his
and he doesn't hear mine.

00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:42.573
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:47.245
- Aw.
- Oh.

00:20:50.415 --> 00:20:52.416
Oh, that's beautiful.

00:20:53.835 --> 00:20:55.253
Funny one! Good!

00:20:57.464 --> 00:20:58.965
Will you marry me?

00:21:00.842 --> 00:21:03.719
- Ha-ha-ha.
- What? I don't get it.

00:21:04.137 --> 00:21:05.179
Oh, yeah!

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:11.060
- Man, this is hilarious!
- Chandler!

00:21:12.312 --> 00:21:14.939
Don't worry, we'll make yours funnier.

00:21:22.906 --> 00:21:24.782
Okay, what do you think?

00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:31.789
- Dude...
- I have never known love like this.

00:21:32.541 --> 00:21:35.084
- You really like it?
- Dude!

00:21:36.503 --> 00:21:38.296
How did you write this?

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:41.090
I stole Monica's
and changed the name. Shh.

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:46.095
- You can't do that!
- If he goes first he can!
