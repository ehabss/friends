WEBVTT

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:06.380
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:09.800
So, what do you think?

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:12.261
- About what?
- What?

00:00:13.346 --> 00:00:16.890
Are you kidding? Okay,
I'll give you a hint. I'll give you a hint.

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.771
Eyes. No, no. Your eyes! No.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.523
Chandler's eyes!

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.443
I got glasses.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.070
You always had glasses.

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:34.450
No, I didn't.

00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:37.244
Are you sure?

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:40.330
Didn't you used to have a pair?

00:00:40.498 --> 00:00:44.668
They were really round and burgundy,
and they made you look kind of, um...

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:46.879
- Feminine.
- Yes!

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:48.297
No.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:51.341
I think the glasses look great.
They make you look sexy.

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:53.010
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:55.387
You didn't think
I used to wear glasses, right?

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:56.597
- Of course.
- Pfft.

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:58.265
I had no idea.

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:55.948
What do you want for
an engagement present?

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:58.242
Oh, that's okay, we're not having a party...

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.203
...so you don't have to get us...
- Ah, buh-buh-buh! Heh.

00:02:01.371 --> 00:02:05.457
If someone wants to give us a present,
we don't want to deprive them of that joy.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:08.961
Oh, you should get them
one of those little CD players.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.504
Oh, I already have one.

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:13.882
Unless someone borrowed it
and left it at the gynecologist.

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:20.556
Yeah, and by "someone"
she means Joey.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.350
Hey, I know what I want!

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:26.311
- What we want, honey.
- No, you don't want this.

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.982
I want to have your grandmother's
cookie recipe.

00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:32.609
You mean the chocolate chip
cookie recipe?

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.611
- Uh-huh, yeah.
- The one my grandmother...

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.446
...made me swear on her deathbed...

00:02:36.614 --> 00:02:39.074
...that I would never
let out of our family?

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:42.870
Dying people say the craziest things.

00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:47.833
I've wanted it for years. I was gonna
make cookies for my children.

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:51.503
Break my heart. Oh, all right.

00:02:51.713 --> 00:02:55.215
I'll be the mom who makes the
world's best chocolate chip cookies.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:58.719
Our kids are gonna be fat,
aren't they?

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:02.264
- Ahoy!
- Hey.

00:03:02.473 --> 00:03:05.184
- How's the boat?
- I'm getting into this sailing stuff.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.186
You finally took it out of the marina?

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:09.271
Why would I do that?

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:12.858
It took three guys
to get the thing in there.

00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:15.777
If you don't sail it,
what do you do on it?

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:17.863
It's a great place
to just kind of sit...

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:21.491
...hang around, drink a few beers,
eat some chips.

00:03:23.036 --> 00:03:26.288
It's good that you finally
have a place to do that.

00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:29.374
Joey, I could teach you
to sail if you want.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:32.002
- You could?
- Yeah, I've been sailing my whole life.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.214
When I was 15,
my dad bought me my own boat.

00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:38.800
- Your own boat?
- He was trying to cheer me up.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.886
My pony was sick.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:54.399
- You know what I was thinking?
- What?

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.944
Nothing, I just like to go like this.

00:03:58.154 --> 00:04:01.323
- Chandler, what are you doing tonight?
- Why, do you have a lecture?

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:04.785
- No, why?
- Then, free as a bird. What's up?

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:07.746
Uh, my dad wants to know if you want
to play racquetball.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.623
Wow, that's great! Dad must like you.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:12.876
- He doesn't ask just anyone to play.
- He didn't really ask for you.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:16.546
He asked for "Chauncey."
I assumed he meant you.

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:18.632
Did you correct him?

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.426
No, I thought it would be
more fun this way.

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.347
Maybe this is something
you could do this every week.

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.015
Or you could sit on the porch...

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:29.643
...and make sure no one
steals the trashcans.

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:31.937
He does that every week too.

00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:36.566
Just so you know, you have to let
him win. He hates to lose.

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:39.736
Oh, no problem.
Maybe I'll play with my left hand.

00:04:40.905 --> 00:04:42.197
You're not a lefty?

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:45.367
Does anybody know me?

00:04:50.456 --> 00:04:51.498
What's wrong, Phoebe?

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:55.085
I just went to my old apartment
to get you the cookie recipe...

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.796
...and that stupid fire burned it up!

00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:01.883
No! Why didn't you make a copy
and keep it in a fireproof box...

00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:05.012
...and keep it at least 100 yards
away from the original?

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:13.312
Because I'm normal.

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.691
That was the one legacy
my grandmother left me.

00:05:17.942 --> 00:05:20.777
And I know you wanted it
as an engagement present.

00:05:20.945 --> 00:05:23.113
We have to get you
an engagement present?

00:05:24.073 --> 00:05:25.324
Don't worry about it.

00:05:25.533 --> 00:05:28.076
No one got me an engagement present.

00:05:28.453 --> 00:05:32.247
Okay, here.
I don't have the recipe, but here.

00:05:32.498 --> 00:05:34.916
I wish you health
and happiness.

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:37.961
An old cookie?

00:05:38.254 --> 00:05:41.590
See, this is what happens
when you don't register for gifts.

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:47.429
I made a batch and I froze it.
And this is the only one left.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:50.098
- We can't accept this.
- Why not?

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.101
Because it's gross.

00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:57.064
No, wait. I think I can figure out
the recipe from this cookie.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:58.732
I do this at work all the time.

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.442
- Really?
- Yeah, I think I can.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:01.985
Oh, yay!

00:06:05.406 --> 00:06:07.282
Okay, Ross, we owe you a present.

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:09.785
Two! I've been engaged twice.

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.295
Look at this clown.

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.799
Because he's got a bigger boat
he thinks he can take up the whole river.

00:06:23.966 --> 00:06:26.676
Get out of the way, jackass!

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:31.056
Who names their boat
Coast Guard, anyway?

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.812
- That is the Coast Guard.
- What are they doing out here?

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.231
The coast is all the way over there.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:41.608
Joey, just ignore the boats.

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.069
- We're not finished with our lesson.
- All right.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:46.488
I'm gonna go over the basic
points one more time.

00:06:46.656 --> 00:06:49.825
Come on, Rach. Not again. I got it, okay?
Let's start sailing!

00:06:49.992 --> 00:06:53.620
I want to go over there
where that boatload of girls is. Yeah, oh!

00:06:54.872 --> 00:06:56.248
Oh, is that what you wanna do?

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:59.167
You want to give a shout out
to the old hot chicas?

00:06:59.335 --> 00:07:01.670
Okay, let's do that, Sailor Joe.

00:07:01.838 --> 00:07:05.006
Quick question, though:
What's this called?

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.469
- Uh, boat rope?
- Wrong.

00:07:09.637 --> 00:07:12.347
- How do you get the mainsail up?
- Uh...

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:14.599
Rub it?

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:21.148
No. What do you do if I say
we're coming about?

00:07:21.315 --> 00:07:23.733
I'd say, "Come again?" Ha, ha.

00:07:23.901 --> 00:07:26.445
No, no, I know this one.
I know this one. Uh, um...

00:07:28.739 --> 00:07:30.532
Time's up. Now you're dead.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:31.825
And deaf!

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:34.161
Okay, you go on
and make your little jokes.

00:07:34.328 --> 00:07:36.371
If you don't know
what you're doing at sea...

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:39.958
...you will die at sea.
Am I getting through to you, sailor?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.461
- Yes.
- Don't just say yes.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:45.172
This isn't a game.
You could get hurt out here!

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:48.133
So do you want to pay attention,
or do you want to die?

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:54.264
I want to make a
ship-to-shore call to Chandler.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:06.526
- All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.
- You do?

00:08:06.694 --> 00:08:09.529
You don't? Heh.
Well, that's the difference...

00:08:09.697 --> 00:08:11.531
...between a professional and a layman.

00:08:13.242 --> 00:08:14.951
That and arrogance.

00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:18.163
Hey.

00:08:18.372 --> 00:08:19.915
Hey. How was sailing?

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.626
I don't want to talk about it.

00:08:23.294 --> 00:08:25.253
- You could've saved me a whole cookie.
- No!

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.593
Women are mean!

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:37.557
I can't believe that.

00:08:37.725 --> 00:08:41.061
Now the only thing left
of my grandmother's legacy is...

00:08:41.229 --> 00:08:42.896
...this crumb.

00:08:44.815 --> 00:08:47.692
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.572
- Hey.
- How was it?

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.449
Well, I had a great time.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:57.953
Um, Chauncey on the other hand...

00:08:58.162 --> 00:09:00.163
I will tell the story.

00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:03.500
It was going great.
I let him win, we were bonding...

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.585
...he even said I could call him Dad.

00:09:05.753 --> 00:09:07.587
And what did he ask you
not to call him?

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:10.006
"Daddy."

00:09:11.175 --> 00:09:13.134
Look, here's the story.

00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:16.429
We had just finished playing racquetball...

00:09:16.597 --> 00:09:18.223
...and we were gonna take a steam.

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:19.975
I walk into the steam room...

00:09:20.142 --> 00:09:22.060
...and it's really steamy.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.816
So I take off my glasses,
and that's when it happened.

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:29.025
Guys?

00:09:29.193 --> 00:09:32.195
- Over here.
- Have a seat, son.

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:39.369
Hey!

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.382
- Oh, my God, Chandler! I can't believe it.
- I know.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.968
You gave my father a lap dance.

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.974
Why do they put
so much steam in there?

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:07.272
Because otherwise they'd
have to call it the "room" room.

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:12.861
Why, okay? Why?
Why did that have to happen?

00:10:13.654 --> 00:10:15.280
Come on, it's not that big a deal.

00:10:15.489 --> 00:10:17.866
Not that big a deal? There...

00:10:18.117 --> 00:10:20.493
There was touching of things.

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.871
I know you wanted
to bond with my dad...

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:26.249
...but did you have to bond
to that part?

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:33.089
Listen, I'm sure Dad doesn't care.
He probably thought this was funny.

00:10:33.257 --> 00:10:35.050
He'll be telling this story for years.

00:10:35.217 --> 00:10:38.011
I don't want him to tell
this story for years.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:40.597
Oh, but he will.

00:10:41.432 --> 00:10:45.518
He still tells the story about how
Monica tried to escape from fat camp.

00:10:47.355 --> 00:10:48.480
I wasn't escaping.

00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:50.940
Then how'd you get caught
in the barbed wire?

00:10:52.109 --> 00:10:53.818
I was trying to help out a squirrel.

00:10:54.028 --> 00:10:55.820
You were trying to eat it.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.993
If that is your father calling
to tell this story...

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:03.953
...then the marriage is off!

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:06.539
Come on. Hello.

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:09.584
I'm sorry, you have the wrong number.

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:11.753
Okay, I'll call you later, Dad. I love you.

00:11:18.469 --> 00:11:20.637
- All right, I'm off to see your dad.
- Oh, whoa.

00:11:20.846 --> 00:11:23.014
Aren't you a little overdressed?

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:27.727
Yeah, and you better make sure
he tips you this time.

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:32.107
I figured I would try to convince
him not to tell the story anymore...

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:35.235
...and I figured the best way
to do that was face to face.

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:37.987
And by "face," I don't mean his lap.

00:11:38.239 --> 00:11:41.074
And by "face," I don't mean my ass.

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:46.663
Are you getting Monica
and Chandler an engagement present?

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:49.249
I don't know. You know,
they didn't get us anything.

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:51.084
Thank you!

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:54.212
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:55.964
Well, hello.

00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:59.050
So when are we getting
back out on the water, matey?

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:03.471
Oh, uh, I don't know the boat way
to say this, but, never.

00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:09.060
- Why not?
- Because you're mean on the boat.

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:11.521
Wha...? I was just trying to teach you.

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:14.107
Well, lesson learned.
Rachel is mean.

00:12:15.067 --> 00:12:18.194
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.573
I remember when she took me out
on her dad's boat.

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.575
She wouldn't let me help out at all.

00:12:23.784 --> 00:12:27.162
Excuse me, I wanted you to help.
But you couldn't move your arms...

00:12:27.413 --> 00:12:30.373
...because you were wearing
three life jackets.

00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:34.461
You have to respect the sea.

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:38.798
Look, Joey, I'm sorry if you thought
that was mean.

00:12:38.966 --> 00:12:41.134
But I tell you something,
that was not mean.

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:45.096
My father is mean. He used to yell at me
all the time on the boat.

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:48.433
It was horrible.
I was being a really good teacher.

00:12:48.642 --> 00:12:51.519
Does a good teacher say,
"Put down the beer, pinhead!"

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:55.774
Does a good student drink 7 beers
during his first lesson?

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.525
Six and a half.

00:12:58.068 --> 00:13:00.028
You knocked that last one
out of my hand.

00:13:00.237 --> 00:13:02.155
I didn't want you to get hit
by the boom.

00:13:02.364 --> 00:13:03.698
Well, it hit me anyway.

00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:07.118
It would have hurt a lot less
if I had finished that last beer.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.249
I'm sorry. I will try to tone it down
and, uh, stop yelling.

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:16.544
- You won't boss me around?
- I won't boss you around.

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:18.338
- And you'll be nice?
- I'll be nice.

00:13:18.506 --> 00:13:21.216
- And you'll be topless?
- And I... Joey!

00:13:21.383 --> 00:13:22.801
You want me to learn?

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:30.266
Okay, here's batch 22.

00:13:30.434 --> 00:13:32.477
Maybe these'll taste
like your grandmother's.

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:35.396
This has a bit of orange peel,
but no nutmeg.

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:37.482
- Mm. Let's give it a shot.
- Ugh.

00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:40.193
I have not made so many cookies
since 9th grade.

00:13:40.402 --> 00:13:44.113
- What was that for, a bake sale?
- No, just a Friday night.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.578
Mm. These are pretty good.

00:13:50.746 --> 00:13:53.206
- Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.
- Mm-mm.

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:54.457
Which one was that?

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.793
The ones we had
after you almost threw up.

00:13:57.837 --> 00:14:00.421
Oh, yeah, batch 17 was good.

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:03.299
I did not like batch 16.

00:14:04.802 --> 00:14:06.427
I'm okay.

00:14:07.596 --> 00:14:10.682
Are there any more from the good batch?
We could work off those.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.561
Well, yeah, I think there's one
from batch 17 left. Uh...

00:14:18.983 --> 00:14:22.485
Batch 16.
Sixteen, people, get out of the way!

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:33.746
Okay, Joey.
Honey, you're doing really good.

00:14:33.956 --> 00:14:37.083
I just need you
to step to the portside.

00:14:41.463 --> 00:14:43.965
Remember how we
talked about the portside?

00:14:44.174 --> 00:14:45.717
- Oh, yeah.
- Right?

00:14:45.926 --> 00:14:47.093
No.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:52.473
It's left, sweetie, but that's okay.
That's a tough one.

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:54.100
Why not just say left?

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:56.060
Okay, go to the left.

00:15:00.691 --> 00:15:02.233
Ahem, the left.

00:15:02.401 --> 00:15:03.651
- Huh?
- Just sit over there!

00:15:03.819 --> 00:15:06.070
Okay! Okay!
You're yelling again. See that?

00:15:06.238 --> 00:15:10.199
Oh, no, no. Very quiet.
Said with love, no yelling.

00:15:12.494 --> 00:15:13.745
You know what?

00:15:13.913 --> 00:15:17.332
Since I'm here, I'm gonna have
a beer on the portside.

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:20.335
See what I did there? Ha, ha.

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:27.133
We're luffing a little.
Will you tighten up the Cunningham?

00:15:27.718 --> 00:15:31.471
Whoa, you just said a bunch
of stuff I don't know.

00:15:31.639 --> 00:15:34.390
Joey, come on!
We just went over this.

00:15:34.558 --> 00:15:38.770
Oh, when we did that was when that bird
was overhead with the fish in his mouth.

00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:42.023
- Did you see it? It was gross.
- No! I did not see the bird.

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:46.319
I did not see the fish! I did not see the
piece of Styrofoam shaped like Mike Tyson!

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:51.908
I did not, because I was trying
to teach you how to sail a boat.

00:15:52.076 --> 00:15:54.869
Which obviously is
an impossible thing to do.

00:15:55.037 --> 00:15:58.164
That's it! You're yelling,
and I don't see you taking your top off.

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:00.166
I quit!

00:16:00.751 --> 00:16:03.336
- What do you mean? You can't quit.
- Why not?

00:16:03.504 --> 00:16:07.048
Because you're not finished!
I won't have it. Greens do not quit.

00:16:08.008 --> 00:16:09.634
Greens?

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:12.971
I'm a Tribbiani. Tribbianis quit.

00:16:16.308 --> 00:16:17.392
Oh, my God. Wait.

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:20.687
Did I...? I just said,
"Greens don't quit," didn't I?

00:16:20.896 --> 00:16:25.525
- Did I say, "Greens don't quit"?
- Yes! And you're still yelling at me.

00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:28.611
No, I'm not yelling at you.
I'm just yelling near you.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.697
Oh, God, Joey. Oh, I'm my father.

00:16:30.948 --> 00:16:33.616
Oh, my God. This is horrible.

00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:38.621
I've been trying so hard not to be
my mother, I did not see this coming.

00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:41.833
Ugh, Joey.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:46.879
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
I just wanted you to learn.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:50.925
- Ugh.
- Hey, I...

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:52.677
I did learn.

00:16:52.845 --> 00:16:54.971
- Really?
- Yeah, come on.

00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:58.016
- No.
- Yeah. It's okay.

00:16:58.225 --> 00:17:00.643
I know what a mainsail is. Huh?

00:17:00.811 --> 00:17:04.731
I know to duck when
the boom comes across.

00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:08.026
- I know port is right.
- Left.

00:17:08.235 --> 00:17:09.736
Damn it!

00:17:12.781 --> 00:17:15.241
You know, I bet it would
make my grandma happy...

00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:18.369
...to know that we're trying
to figure out her recipe.

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.082
I bet she's looking up at us
and smiling right now.

00:17:24.668 --> 00:17:26.502
Looking up?

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:31.299
Oh, yeah, no, she was really nice to me
but she's in hell for sure.

00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:35.136
Well, I've tried everything. I give up.

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:38.181
I'm not gonna be the mom
who makes the world's best cookies.

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:43.603
I do make the best
duck confit with broccoli raab.

00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:45.021
Kids love that, right?

00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:50.568
Aw, Pheeb, isn't there any relative
that would have the recipe?

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:52.403
What about your sister?

00:17:52.613 --> 00:17:55.448
Oh, no. I made a promise
to myself that the next time...

00:17:55.657 --> 00:17:58.785
...I would talk to Ursula
is over my dead body.

00:18:00.204 --> 00:18:04.791
And that's not happening
until October 15, 2032.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.168
That's the day you're gonna die? See.

00:18:07.336 --> 00:18:10.338
Darn it, I've got shuffleboard that day.
Heh.

00:18:11.256 --> 00:18:13.216
That's what you think.

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:19.847
What about friends of your grandmother?
Would they have the recipe?

00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:23.601
You know, I may have relatives in France
who would know.

00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.603
My grandmother said
she got the recipe...

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:29.357
...from her grandmother,
"Nestley Toulouse."

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:32.276
What was her name?

00:18:33.028 --> 00:18:36.280
Nestley Toulouse.

00:18:37.491 --> 00:18:39.867
Nestlé Toll House?

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:44.914
Ugh.

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:47.792
You Americans always butcher
the French language.

00:18:49.753 --> 00:18:52.255
Phoebe, is this the recipe?

00:18:54.758 --> 00:18:56.134
Yes!

00:18:59.263 --> 00:19:00.429
Oh.

00:19:01.014 --> 00:19:04.934
I cannot believe that I spent the last two
days trying to figure out that recipe.

00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:06.811
It was in my cupboard the whole time!

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:10.940
I know! You see, it is stuff like this...

00:19:11.108 --> 00:19:13.651
...which is why you're burning in hell!

00:19:17.781 --> 00:19:19.031
So you understand.

00:19:19.199 --> 00:19:21.909
I'd feel more comfortable
if you didn't tell people.

00:19:22.077 --> 00:19:24.745
You know,
I'm a little embarrassed about it.

00:19:24.913 --> 00:19:28.291
I understand completely.
There's nothing more horrifying...

00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.960
...than embarrassing yourself
in front of your in-laws.

00:19:31.128 --> 00:19:35.506
As a matter of fact, when I started
dating Judy, I was unemployed.

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:37.717
Her father asked me
what I did for a living.

00:19:37.885 --> 00:19:40.094
- I told him I was a lawyer.
- Heh.

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:42.680
- What'd you do when they found out?
- They never did.

00:19:42.848 --> 00:19:46.559
So if you ever see me giving them
legal advice, just nod along.

00:19:48.061 --> 00:19:49.312
Shall we?

00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:07.371
So, I guess we wear swimsuits in here.

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:22.845
Well, Joey, I hate to admit it...

00:20:23.055 --> 00:20:25.681
...your way of sailing
is a lot more fun.

00:20:26.725 --> 00:20:28.142
Yep, yep.

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.479
Hey, why don't you give a pull
on that rope?

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:32.855
We're not sailing.

00:20:33.023 --> 00:20:36.275
- Just pull on it.
- All right.

00:20:38.362 --> 00:20:40.905
- Hey!
- Eh?

00:20:41.073 --> 00:20:42.865
Sandwiches!

00:20:43.033 --> 00:20:45.284
- What else?
- Ha, ha.

00:20:45.577 --> 00:20:47.203
Here you go.

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:50.623
- Thank you.
- Oh, wow.

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.669
- What are you doing?
- Oops. Sorry.

00:20:54.836 --> 00:20:58.005
Don't hold it like that.
You're letting all the good stuff fall out.

00:20:58.173 --> 00:20:59.924
- Oh. Oops.
- Careful!

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:02.593
You're wasting good pastrami!

00:21:05.472 --> 00:21:08.349
Oh, my God. I'm my dad!
