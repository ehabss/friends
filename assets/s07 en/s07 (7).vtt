00:00:03.461 --> 00:00:05.295
- Morning.
- Hi.

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:07.297
How was your date?

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.883
- Pretty good.
- Oh, good.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.388
- Aah!
- My God. Sorry about that.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.850
Okay, really good.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:19.643
I gotta go. I'm late.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.937
You're going to leave her with me?

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:24.189
Don't worry, she's a terrific girl.

00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:25.774
Can you do me a favor?

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:30.404
Could you mention I'm not looking
for a relationship? That'd be great.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.573
What, are you kidding?

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:36.201
Just casually slip it in, you know.
Lay the groundwork.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.705
Tell her I'm a loner. No, an outlaw.

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:43.042
She doesn't want to get mixed up
with the likes of me.

00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:44.626
That's a lot to remember.

00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.962
Can't I tell her that you're a pig?

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.965
I'm gonna call her later myself.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:51.425
Honest.

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:54.720
Chandler used to do it.
He'd make her pancakes.

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.639
He'd make extras and leave them for me.

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:01.393
I'm not telling her anything.
It's not my responsibility.

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:02.853
Fine.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:06.523
Now, where did we land
on those pancakes?

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:11.612
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:15.032
Sorry, but I couldn't get
that lock to work.

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.327
Yeah, Joey kind of disabled it
when I moved in.

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:21.705
- You must be Rachel. I'm Erin.
- Hi.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:26.919
I don't mean this to sound like high
school, but did he talk about me?

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.256
Would you like some pancakes?

00:02:13.383 --> 00:02:17.261
- Come on. Why are we here?
- Okay, okay, take a guess.

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.222
The hot chicks?

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.893
Okay, okay, I was typing names
into the library computer earlier...

00:02:25.145 --> 00:02:26.311
...you know, for fun.

00:02:27.021 --> 00:02:29.773
And I typed mine in,
and guess what came up?

00:02:30.024 --> 00:02:31.859
My doctoral dissertation.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.155
It's right down here in the biggest
library in the university.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.032
Wow, that's actually pretty cool.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.121
There's also a book here
by a woman named Wendy Bagina.

00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:48.333
What is that?

00:02:49.335 --> 00:02:53.422
Sounds like two people are really
enjoying the Dewey decimal system.

00:02:57.886 --> 00:03:00.220
We're so sorry.

00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:06.268
You didn't bring me here to do that,
did you?

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:14.651
She sent the chicken back again?

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.989
She said it's too dry and wants
to explain to you how she wants it.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.533
I'd like to meet this chicken expert.

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:23.535
Send the colonel in.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:32.336
Oh, my God!

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:35.881
Lucky bastard.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.468
- Janice.
- How are you...

00:03:39.677 --> 00:03:44.806
...Ms. Hotshot-Chef-at-the-Big-Fancy-
Restaurant-With-the-Best-Chicken-Ever?

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.228
I'm fine.

00:03:49.437 --> 00:03:52.898
Oh, what is that on your finger?
I'm blind.

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:55.359
Oh, uh...

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:58.278
So who's the lucky guy?

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.533
Oh, my God.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:07.120
I am so sorry, sweetie.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.248
Are you okay?

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.209
You didn't tell her we're engaged?

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:14.920
- She saw the ring.
- Did she freak out?

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.382
She was shocked,
but then again, so were most people.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:19.967
Eh.

00:04:20.343 --> 00:04:22.970
She actually has a boyfriend herself.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:24.888
Name's Clark.

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.933
She also invited herself to our wedding.

00:04:28.101 --> 00:04:29.810
Clark too.

00:04:31.646 --> 00:04:32.938
You said no, right?

00:04:34.148 --> 00:04:35.399
Huh?

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:39.111
You said no, right?

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.447
She cornered me. She asked me
if the wedding was in town.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.616
- What was I supposed to do?
- Lie.

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:48.370
How hard is that?
"Your check's in the mail."

00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:51.665
"Oh, your baby's so cute."

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:55.544
"I can't wait to read your book, Ross."

00:04:57.255 --> 00:05:00.090
So she comes to the wedding.
Maybe it won't be so bad.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.136
Think she'll sit quietly?
Think she'll want to make a toast?

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:08.140
You don't think she'll want
to sing "Part-Time Lover"?

00:05:08.891 --> 00:05:12.811
Oh, my God. She's not gonna like
the chicken either, is she?

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.816
You know what? It'll be okay.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.569
She's probably not gonna even
want to come.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:24.114
- Really?
- No, that was a lie.

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.658
See how easy that was?

00:05:27.535 --> 00:05:30.412
So you would have just lied?

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:32.039
Yes.

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:36.209
- It would have really been that easy?
- Yes.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:39.504
Do it Saturday. We're having
dinner with her and Clark.

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:47.929
Hey, what's up?

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.556
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:52.517
Hey, who's your friend?

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:54.144
Hey!

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.688
- Hey, Joey.
- Erin.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:05:59.066
You're still here.

00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:04.696
We ended up spending the day together
and had such a great time.

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:07.699
Why wouldn't you? Erin is great.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.243
And then there's you guys.

00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:13.789
Well, listen, I better get going.

00:06:13.956 --> 00:06:15.457
- Today was great. Thanks.
- I know.

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:16.708
Okay.

00:06:16.918 --> 00:06:19.378
And Joey, last night was fun.

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:21.963
Yeah. I'll call you.

00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:24.091
- I'll call you too.
- Or I'll call you.

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:25.967
- And call me.
- Okay.

00:06:26.761 --> 00:06:28.178
- Good to see you again.
- Bye.

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:30.472
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:35.018
The system kind of broke down, huh?

00:06:35.937 --> 00:06:39.523
Joey, I'm sorry. I just couldn't
tell her all those things.

00:06:39.732 --> 00:06:41.525
And we got to talking, and I...

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:43.735
We want you to marry her.

00:06:44.695 --> 00:06:45.737
What?

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:48.448
She is so amazing. You have no idea.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:50.534
Who do you think brought her here?

00:06:50.785 --> 00:06:52.119
Cupid.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.790
She's so cool.
She speaks four languages.

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:00.168
Man, do you know what guys want.

00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:06.508
Come on, she's so perfect for you.
She's sweet.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:10.053
She likes baseball.
She had two beers at lunch.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.805
My beers?!

00:07:13.433 --> 00:07:15.267
Look, she's a very nice girl.

00:07:15.476 --> 00:07:18.520
We had a very good time,
but I don't see it going anywhere.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.147
You always say that.

00:07:20.356 --> 00:07:23.233
Maybe if you gave her a chance,
it would go somewhere.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:26.236
I'm sorry, you guys. I just don't think so.

00:07:26.904 --> 00:07:28.697
- Whatever.
- Fine.

00:07:28.906 --> 00:07:31.741
Hey, don't start judging me.

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:33.910
You're in love with your assistant.

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:37.873
You're sleeping with the guy
who keeps pigeons on the roof.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:40.083
Phoebe!

00:07:40.376 --> 00:07:42.377
Secret affair.

00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:55.098
People are doing it in front of my book.

00:07:56.767 --> 00:07:57.976
I'm sorry?

00:07:58.144 --> 00:08:02.481
My doctoral dissertation is in the library
at school. I went to see it.

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:08.236
And there were students making babies
right in the paleontology section.

00:08:08.654 --> 00:08:11.865
Oh, my God.
Did you get to see anything good?

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.284
At your school...

00:08:14.494 --> 00:08:19.623
...was there a place on campus
where students went to fool around?

00:08:19.957 --> 00:08:21.082
Yeah, there was.

00:08:21.334 --> 00:08:25.795
In the corner of the library where all
the books were that nobody ever read.

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.131
Yes, there was.

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:32.511
Great, because people kept showing up.
I think it's like a thing.

00:08:32.887 --> 00:08:34.429
Hold on a second.

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.933
Fifth floor, against that back wall?

00:08:39.810 --> 00:08:41.686
Oh, for crying out loud!

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:47.442
- So we should go catch our movie.
- What's the rush?

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:50.362
I'd like to see the previews.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.864
The candy.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.577
- Oh, hey.
- Well, look who's here.

00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:59.329
- Hey, Joey.
- Hey, Erin.

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.789
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi.

00:09:00.998 --> 00:09:03.625
We were about to take off
and see a movie.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:07.420
- Oh, no!
- What's wrong?

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:11.841
Phoebe, we forgot that party
we have to go to.

00:09:12.051 --> 00:09:13.927
Oh, no.

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:15.971
What party?

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.098
A birthday party.

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:20.642
Whose birthday party?

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:23.103
Alison's birthday party.

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:26.940
Oh. And how old is Alison?

00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:28.567
Thirty-two.

00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:35.407
Wait a minute.
Why don't you guys do something?

00:09:35.616 --> 00:09:38.285
Look how that worked out.

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:46.501
Excuse me. Hi, I'm a professor here.

00:09:46.752 --> 00:09:51.548
Do you know the paleontology section,
fifth floor, stack 437?

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:54.634
Well, yes. Just give me five minutes.

00:09:54.885 --> 00:09:58.138
I just have to find someone
to cover my shift.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:03.393
No, no, no.

00:10:03.644 --> 00:10:05.645
Can I speak to someone in charge?

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:10.567
How can I help?

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:14.112
Hi, I was wondering, is it possible
to increase security...

00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:16.281
...in the paleontology section?

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:18.199
I wrote a book that's up there.

00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:20.785
And instead of reading it, people are...

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.164
Well, they're rolling around in front of it.

00:10:25.249 --> 00:10:29.085
We are aware of the problem
you're referring to.

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:37.052
As far as increasing security,
I'm afraid the library's understaffed.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.721
I can't help you.

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:41.765
Well, fine.

00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:44.684
If I'm the only person
with any appreciation...

00:10:44.852 --> 00:10:48.688
...of the sanctity of the written word,
then I'll go defend it myself.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.691
Don't you follow me.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.779
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:59.157
- How did it go with Erin?
- Unbelievable.

00:10:59.408 --> 00:11:01.368
We had the best time.

00:11:01.535 --> 00:11:02.535
Yay!

00:11:02.703 --> 00:11:06.164
- So you're not mad anymore?
- No, no. You guys were totally right.

00:11:06.374 --> 00:11:08.625
This was much better than the first date.

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:11.378
It was awkward. We were both nervous.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:14.673
- Didn't you sleep together?
- Yeah, that calms me down.

00:11:16.801 --> 00:11:18.677
And we have so much in common.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:24.349
She loves sandwiches, sports.
Although she is a Met fan.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.060
Not an issue now, but if we had kids...

00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:31.356
Oh, my God! Listen to you talking
about having kids.

00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:34.901
Oh, my Joey.

00:11:35.152 --> 00:11:37.862
- Please don't get married before I do.
- Oh.

00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:43.493
Oh!

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:47.372
I just cannot believe
that Clark stood me up.

00:11:47.832 --> 00:11:49.082
He may still show up.

00:11:49.291 --> 00:11:50.542
What are you, stupid?

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:55.338
- It's been three hours.
- Is that all?

00:11:56.298 --> 00:11:59.926
Let's go on to happier things.

00:12:00.136 --> 00:12:02.679
Why don't you tell me
about your lovely wedding?

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:07.684
There was something that we wanted
to tell you about the wedding.

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:11.187
It's going to be a small ceremony.

00:12:11.439 --> 00:12:13.314
Tiny.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.152
We're not even sure why we're having it.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.905
It's actually going to be just family.

00:12:22.116 --> 00:12:25.577
Oh, wait.

00:12:26.871 --> 00:12:29.456
You two think of me as family?

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:36.421
I have to ask you something now,
and be honest.

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:41.259
Do you want me to sing
"Careless Whisper" or "Lady in Red"?

00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:46.890
How can you say that?
The Mets have no closer.

00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:50.393
- What about Benitez?
- What about game one of the Series?

00:12:50.644 --> 00:12:53.104
- What about shut up?
- You shut up.

00:12:53.939 --> 00:12:56.065
I love arguing with her.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:58.401
- Be right back.
- Okay.

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:01.154
How's it going with Joey?

00:13:01.363 --> 00:13:03.323
Oh, okay.

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:04.949
Okay?

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:09.162
Tell me that you like him, please.
I mean, tell me that you like him.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.750
He's a really great guy, and I know
you really want this to work out...

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:16.920
...but I just don't see this having a future.

00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.421
What?

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:22.342
But you said that you liked him.
What happened?

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:25.345
Did you just change your mind?

00:13:25.846 --> 00:13:28.556
- Kind of.
- Then change it back!

00:13:29.683 --> 00:13:33.394
I'm sorry. It's just there's no real spark.

00:13:33.604 --> 00:13:35.438
Didn't you sleep together?

00:13:35.856 --> 00:13:37.065
Yeah.

00:13:37.316 --> 00:13:38.983
Tramp.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.362
Does Joey have any idea?

00:13:42.613 --> 00:13:44.948
I don't think he does. You know what?

00:13:45.199 --> 00:13:47.951
Maybe you could tell him
I'm not interested...

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:50.119
...in a serious relationship.

00:13:51.455 --> 00:13:53.790
You mean, like,
that you're kind of a loner?

00:13:53.999 --> 00:13:55.416
Yeah, that'd be great.

00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:59.504
- And maybe that you're a real stronzo.
- I'm sorry?

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:03.383
I guess Italian isn't one
of the four languages you speak.

00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:08.388
- Hey. Want to go?
- Yeah, let's go.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:11.891
- Okay. See you guys later.
- Bye, guys.

00:14:12.601 --> 00:14:14.811
Hey, thank you so much.

00:14:18.399 --> 00:14:19.524
Wow.

00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:22.569
I guess it wasn't Cupid
that brought her here.

00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:26.364
No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

00:14:33.289 --> 00:14:36.040
Yes, yes. How can I help you?

00:14:36.208 --> 00:14:38.001
We were just looking around.

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:40.587
Oh, you're fellow scholars.

00:14:40.754 --> 00:14:43.256
What exactly were you looking for?

00:14:43.424 --> 00:14:44.424
Perhaps...

00:14:44.592 --> 00:14:47.594
Perhaps Dr. Chester Stock's musings...

00:14:47.803 --> 00:14:50.597
...on the Smilodon californicus?

00:14:51.932 --> 00:14:53.099
- Uh...
- Uh! Uh!

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:54.434
Get out of here!

00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:05.653
Meeting someone?

00:15:05.863 --> 00:15:08.573
Or are you just here to brush up...

00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:11.743
...on Merriam's views on evolution?

00:15:12.036 --> 00:15:16.623
Actually, I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:24.547
I find Merriam's views
far too progressionist.

00:15:24.798 --> 00:15:27.967
I'm sorry. Who are you?

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:30.386
I'm a professor here. Ross Geller.

00:15:30.638 --> 00:15:34.307
Ross Geller?
Why do I know that name? It's a...

00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:35.725
Wait.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.022
Did you write this?

00:15:41.899 --> 00:15:43.399
Yes.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:50.490
You're the person
who checked out my book?

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:56.412
You know, you look nothing
like I would have thought.

00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:58.331
You're so young.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.544
Well, I skipped fourth grade.

00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:15.640
I am very, very sorry.

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:22.897
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:24.148
Hi.

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:28.236
- So how was your date?
- Great. We walked around the Village.

00:16:28.404 --> 00:16:31.030
We went to this ice cream place.
Split a milk shake.

00:16:31.281 --> 00:16:32.949
Seventy-thirty, but still.

00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:37.787
I'm thinking of taking her upstate
to one of those bed-and-breakfasts.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.289
Really? She said she wants to go?

00:16:40.541 --> 00:16:45.169
No, it's a surprise. It's gonna be tricky,
because she's busy at work.

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:46.671
- Oh.
- Oh.

00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:50.508
Joey, look, honey, we need to talk, okay?

00:16:51.135 --> 00:16:52.719
Um...

00:16:52.928 --> 00:16:54.929
I got the feeling from her...

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.600
...that she's not looking
for a serious relationship.

00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:03.312
- Where are you getting this?
- She told me.

00:17:05.274 --> 00:17:07.525
She said she's kind of a loner.

00:17:08.777 --> 00:17:14.198
Oh.

00:17:16.076 --> 00:17:18.369
- Joey...
- Hey, Rach, it's cool, you know.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.289
I'm a loner too, right?

00:17:22.416 --> 00:17:25.752
Hey, Joey. You know what?
You are way too good for her.

00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:30.882
I promise, next time I will tell them
you're not looking for a relationship.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.550
No.

00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:36.721
No, don't do that. Just...

00:17:38.599 --> 00:17:41.726
- Next time, make sure she likes me.
- Well, that too.

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.191
Joey?

00:17:49.526 --> 00:17:50.693
Yeah?

00:17:51.528 --> 00:17:53.613
- Do you want some pancakes?
- Finally.

00:17:57.618 --> 00:17:59.202
What are we gonna do?

00:17:59.703 --> 00:18:01.454
I say we go with "Careless Whisper."

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:06.626
Chandler?

00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:09.462
Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.344
Janice, what are you doing here?

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:19.388
I thought I was gonna go back
to my apartment...

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:24.852
...but I just felt like I really
couldn't be alone tonight.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:34.112
I was just wondering if I could maybe
stay here with you.

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:37.698
Just I really feel like I need
to be with family.

00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:42.912
Our kids are gonna call her
Aunt Janice, aren't they?

00:18:43.413 --> 00:18:48.334
Please. Because otherwise,
I really don't know what I might do.

00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:52.630
Aren't you just a teensy bit curious?

00:18:54.049 --> 00:18:56.634
- You have any tissues?
- Yeah, in the bathroom.

00:19:00.222 --> 00:19:01.973
We'll just let her stay.

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:06.602
No. If we let her stay,
she will stay forever.

00:19:07.604 --> 00:19:10.857
- Kind of like your Barcalounger.
- Is that what you're thinking about?

00:19:11.066 --> 00:19:12.859
I never stop thinking about it.

00:19:14.736 --> 00:19:16.070
Hey, you guys?

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.323
Do either one of you want to get
in there before I take my bath?

00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:23.536
Janice, I'm sorry...

00:19:23.787 --> 00:19:27.123
...but you can't stay here tonight.

00:19:27.749 --> 00:19:28.791
Why not?

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:30.585
Honestly?

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:34.046
Our apartment is a hotbed...

00:19:34.298 --> 00:19:36.841
...for electromagnetic activity.

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:41.679
Monica and I have been immunized,
but sadly...

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.474
...you have not.

00:19:51.231 --> 00:19:52.773
I'm gonna need a comforter.

00:19:53.025 --> 00:19:56.527
Do you have a hypoallergenic one?
Because otherwise I get very nasal.

00:20:00.449 --> 00:20:03.367
Do you have a cat?
Because it's already happening.

00:20:03.535 --> 00:20:04.785
Eh. Do you hear that? Listen.

00:20:09.875 --> 00:20:12.251
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
You have to go.

00:20:12.461 --> 00:20:13.461
Why?

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:18.799
Because Chandler still has
feelings for you.

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:23.554
He does?

00:20:23.972 --> 00:20:25.640
Say again?

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:28.684
That's right. That's right.

00:20:28.894 --> 00:20:31.979
And that is why you can't
stay here tonight.

00:20:32.231 --> 00:20:35.358
And probably why you shouldn't come
to the wedding.

00:20:36.235 --> 00:20:39.445
Feelings. Such strong feelings.

00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:45.660
I mean, I realize that his feelings
may never completely go away...

00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:47.912
...but you can.

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:51.832
Oh, my God.

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:55.711
I understand. I am so sorry.

00:20:55.921 --> 00:20:57.421
I'll go.

00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:04.220
Goodbye, Monica.

00:21:04.471 --> 00:21:08.516
I wish you a lifetime
of happiness with him.

00:21:08.725 --> 00:21:09.767
Chandler.

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:14.063
You call me when this goes
in the pooper.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.287
I've got this section covered.

00:21:29.454 --> 00:21:32.498
Yeah, in fact, I've got this baby
to shine in people's eyes.

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:34.375
Okay, see you later.

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.971
I just wanted to show Monica your book.
