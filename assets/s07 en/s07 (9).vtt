WEBVTT

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.131
I'm ready.

00:00:07.298 --> 00:00:08.632
- You sure?
- Uh-huh.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.468
Okay, let me just straighten out
your helmet there.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:15.347
- Thanks, Daddy.
- No, no. One daddy, two mommies.

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:20.060
- All right, it's all yours.
- Okay, okay.

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.520
There you go, there you go.

00:00:22.897 --> 00:00:26.233
Wow, Ben's first big kid's bike.
This is so exciting.

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.402
Oh, yeah, I remember mine.

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:31.113
It was my sixth birthday.
My dad took me to the park...

00:00:31.322 --> 00:00:34.783
...and I got on it and... it bent.
- Yeah.

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:38.454
- I never had a bike of my own.
- What?

00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:40.456
Well, we didn't have a lot of money.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:43.417
But the girl across the street
had the best bike.

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:48.047
It was pink and it had rainbow-colored
tassels hanging off the handle grips...

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:51.258
...and a bell,
and this big, white wicker basket...

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.511
...with those
plastic daisies stuck on.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:57.306
That sounds like my first bike.

00:00:58.767 --> 00:01:00.559
My dad gave me his old one.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.896
- Did the girl ever let you ride it?
- No.

00:01:04.105 --> 00:01:06.482
But she gave me the box
that it came in.

00:01:06.983 --> 00:01:09.818
It had a picture of the bike
on the front.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:14.615
So I would sit on it and my stepdad
would drag me around the backyard.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.034
That is so unfair.

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:20.245
Not really, I got to drag him around too.

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:07.042
Hey, what are you guys doing?

00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:09.336
Making holiday candy for the neighbors.

00:02:09.796 --> 00:02:10.838
I'm sorry, who?

00:02:12.382 --> 00:02:14.466
I'm gonna hang this basket on the door.

00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:17.636
When the neighbors walk by,
they can all take a piece.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:21.265
- But we don't know the neighbors.
- I do.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.643
There's, uh, let's see,
the guy with the mustache...

00:02:24.853 --> 00:02:28.188
...smokes-a-lot lady,
some kids I've seen...

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.442
...and the red-haired guy
who does not like to be called Rusty.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:35.654
See, this is exactly why
I'm making this candy.

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.990
We can learn their names
and get to know our neighbors.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.576
Wouldn't it be easier if we just moved?

00:02:43.204 --> 00:02:45.414
Good morning.

00:02:45.623 --> 00:02:48.959
- Ah, somebody's in a good mood.
- Well, why shouldn't I be?

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:52.171
I have great friends.
I have a wonderful job...

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.131
Where you can make out
with your assistant.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:56.800
Come on, it's not a big deal.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.844
We stayed up all night
coming up with a plan...

00:02:59.012 --> 00:03:01.054
...so that us dating will not be a problem.

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:03.056
Oh, yeah? What's the plan?

00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:09.730
We... We are not...

00:03:10.732 --> 00:03:12.649
...going to let it...

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.526
...be a problem.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.655
Wow. It took you all night
to come up with that plan?

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:20.699
Oh, well, you know,
we did other stuff too.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:23.660
Did you two?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.455
Oh, Monica, you know I don't
sleep with guys on the first date.

00:03:26.664 --> 00:03:29.291
- Matt Wire, Mark Lynn, Ben Wise...
- Anymore.

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:39.635
Hi, Tag, um, I have a conference call
today, is that correct?

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:42.888
- Yes, at 4.
- Okay, thank you, that'll be all.

00:03:43.598 --> 00:03:44.640
Wait, wait.

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.229
Did you see that?

00:03:50.438 --> 00:03:53.565
That mail guy had no idea there was
something going on between us.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:04.743
- I'd better get back to my desk.
- Okay, hard worker.

00:04:06.746 --> 00:04:08.747
I'll remember to put that
in your evaluation.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:12.042
- My what?
- You've been here for two months now...

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:15.921
...and your boss is required
to hand in a performance evaluation.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.008
But you know, there is one thing
that I have yet to evaluate.

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.852
- Are you serious?
- No, I've just always wanted to do that.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.355
Can you help me clean this up?

00:04:39.195 --> 00:04:42.281
The basket is totally empty.
My God, the neighbors ate all the candy.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.074
Well, either that or, uh...

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:47.744
Joey.

00:04:49.956 --> 00:04:50.998
Yeah?

00:04:51.207 --> 00:04:54.334
- Did you eat all the neighbor candy?
- Uh, well, yeah, that was the plan.

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.796
But by the time I got to it
there was only a couple pieces left.

00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:00.132
Yeah. They've been coming by all day.
They love it.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.968
They love my candy?

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.221
- Oh, man, I gotta go make more.
- Hey, Mon.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:11.393
Make some more lasagna too. Something
might have happened to a huge chunk of it.

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.479
Ross, the neighbors ate all my candy.

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.273
Mine stole my newspaper.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:18.066
It's like a crime wave.

00:05:22.238 --> 00:05:24.406
Pheebs, you, uh, got a second?

00:05:24.615 --> 00:05:26.408
- Sure.
- Yeah.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:29.036
Ever since you, uh,
told me that story about that bike...

00:05:29.287 --> 00:05:31.455
...I couldn't stop thinking about it.

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:35.375
I mean, everyone should have
a first bike, you know? So...

00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:42.049
Oh, my God, Ross.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.176
- You like it?
- I love it.

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.678
- Yeah?
- Oh. Oh, God...

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:49.181
- And I love you.
- Ah.

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:50.807
Not that way.

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:53.643
- But the bike got you a lot closer.
- Oh.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.104
Well, uh, take it downstairs.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.148
You know, give it a test drive.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:06:00.525
Okay. Oh, my God.

00:06:00.985 --> 00:06:02.903
My first bike.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:06.198
Thank you for the best present
I've ever gotten.

00:06:06.824 --> 00:06:08.325
You're welcome.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.788
Oh, and Chandler's about to cry.

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:16.249
Am not.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.047
Who is that?

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.927
Don't worry, I'm brave.
I am brave. I... I am brave.

00:06:28.471 --> 00:06:30.263
No, no, no, no, no.

00:06:31.557 --> 00:06:33.809
Can you tell me who is there, please?

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:37.562
My name's Gary. I live upstairs.

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:41.191
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.902
- Do you know what time it is?
- It's candy time.

00:06:45.446 --> 00:06:48.573
My roommate says that they taste
like little drops of heaven.

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:50.659
Oh, please. Heh.

00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:53.829
Did you hear that?
"Little drops of heaven."

00:06:55.415 --> 00:06:56.957
Four a.m.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.376
So can I get some candy?

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:03.839
I am sorry, but some of us
have to get up early and go to work.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.592
He does not know
that I am not "some of us."

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:12.722
Um, listen, I'm sorry, but I'll put some out
first thing in the morning.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:15.308
Well, okay, I'll swing by later.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.394
- You live in this building?
- Mm-hm.

00:07:17.562 --> 00:07:20.480
Mm. Seems like I would have
remembered you.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.527
Mm. Night, Gar.

00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:40.250
So did you read your evaluation yet?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.836
No, it was marked "confidential."

00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:45.088
I just sent it down to human resources.

00:07:48.509 --> 00:07:52.387
Okay, please, you're kidding, right?
I wrote that one as a joke for you.

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.431
A joke they would appreciate?

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:57.017
I'm thinking no.

00:07:57.685 --> 00:08:02.063
- What did you say?
- Um, I said that you were a good kisser...

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:06.610
...and, uh, that I liked
your teeny, tiny tushy.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:09.779
No, not my tushy.

00:08:09.989 --> 00:08:11.114
Well, it gets worse.

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.241
When asked if you take initiative,
I wrote:

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:16.995
"Yes, he was able to unhook my bra
with minimal supervision."

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:22.876
And under problems with performance,
I wrote, "Dear God, I hope not."

00:08:23.461 --> 00:08:27.547
And then, uh...
And then I drew a little smiley face.

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.967
And then a small pornographic sketch.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:43.188
Ross, that is so sweet of you
to get Phoebe that bike.

00:08:43.397 --> 00:08:45.690
When I heard the story, I almost cried.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.400
Almost cried, huh?

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.986
Hear that, Chandler? "Almost" cried.

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:54.491
Hey, you cry every time
somebody talks about Titanic.

00:08:54.867 --> 00:08:57.285
Those two had only each other.

00:08:58.454 --> 00:08:59.871
Phoebe really likes the bike, huh?

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:02.666
Oh, yeah. I saw her
walking it down the street the other day.

00:09:02.875 --> 00:09:05.961
She had these flowers in the basket.
It was so cute.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.964
Yeah, I saw her this morning
walking it by the park.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.760
Wait a minute, she was walking the bike?
Both times?

00:09:15.012 --> 00:09:17.222
- Hey, Pheebs.
- Oh, hi.

00:09:17.473 --> 00:09:21.268
- Hey, so you enjoying the bike?
- Oh, uh-huh, so much. Heh.

00:09:21.978 --> 00:09:27.065
Pheebs, you, uh... You do know
how to ride a bike, don't you? Heh.

00:09:28.859 --> 00:09:30.277
Of course.

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:33.613
Can we see you ride it?

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.448
Okay.

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:51.381
See?

00:09:59.557 --> 00:10:02.350
This is why I told you
never get involved with your assistant.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.937
And there's no such thing as keeping
secrets when it comes to having affairs.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:08.940
Did you hear that, Chandler?

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:11.109
No such thing.

00:10:12.778 --> 00:10:15.488
What happened? I'm just eating candy.

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:21.119
Maybe it's not as bad as I think.
Maybe they didn't take it the way I meant it.

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:25.040
Absolutely, you know?
Because "tushy" can mean both ass...

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.791
...and good worker.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.712
Ugh, I just gotta get the thing back.

00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:32.881
Rach? That sketch you mentioned?

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.717
Might it have looked
a little something like this?

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:37.886
Oh, my God, Joey.

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.098
- What is the matter with you?
- God.

00:10:43.684 --> 00:10:47.062
I tell you, this little talent came in handy
before I could afford porn.

00:10:52.943 --> 00:10:57.322
Hi, I'm sorry. I know it's after hours,
but I really need candy.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:11:00.825
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
See? Rules are rules.

00:11:01.035 --> 00:11:04.037
Please, I have people coming
from out of town today.

00:11:04.246 --> 00:11:07.123
- I told them all about your candy.
- You're kidding.

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:10.377
Out-of-towners, huh? Heh.
What did you tell them?

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:14.005
I told them your candy
was absolutely indescribable.

00:11:14.256 --> 00:11:19.219
Well, some people have been saying it's
"little drops of heaven," but whatever.

00:11:19.804 --> 00:11:23.765
- Please, can't you help me out?
- Hey, Chandler, do we know that lady?

00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:28.019
Maybe. Isn't she the woman who lives
below you and has sex really loud?

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:30.438
All right, I'll do it just this once.

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:33.900
- But you can't tell anybody.
- Yes, yes, please, just give it to me.

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:36.319
Yeah, that's her.

00:11:37.154 --> 00:11:39.155
- Thank you.
- Unbelievable.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.783
I can't believe that sign didn't work.

00:11:41.992 --> 00:11:44.994
You know what would work?
Stop making candy.

00:11:45.913 --> 00:11:47.247
But they like it.

00:11:48.082 --> 00:11:49.499
You mean they like you.

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:51.835
Maybe.

00:11:52.211 --> 00:11:55.463
Is that why you became a chef,
so that people would like you?

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:59.759
Heh. You want to talk about getting
people to like you, huh, funny man?

00:12:09.437 --> 00:12:12.689
Okay, now, just remember
everything I taught you and you'll be fine.

00:12:12.898 --> 00:12:14.649
Okay? Here we go.

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:16.776
Ready, set...

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.904
Wait, this seat is really uncomfortable.

00:12:20.156 --> 00:12:23.283
Maybe before we start
we should just get another one.

00:12:23.492 --> 00:12:26.911
Perhaps like an airplane seat,
or a beanbag chair.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:32.000
Phoebe, you can't get out of this, okay?
You have to learn how to ride a bike.

00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:35.128
Why? Why do I have to learn?

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:40.508
- Well, in case of an emergency.
- What kind of emergency?

00:12:40.718 --> 00:12:45.180
Well, what if a man comes along
and puts a gun to your head and says:

00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:48.057
"You ride this bike or I'll...

00:12:48.350 --> 00:12:50.769
I'll shoot you."

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:53.521
Okay. I would ring the bell
to distract him...

00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:57.400
...and then I would knock the gun out
of his hand with a Chinese throwing star.

00:12:58.569 --> 00:13:01.821
Okay, Phoebe, just get on the bike...

00:13:02.072 --> 00:13:05.867
...and, hey, I'll hold you up
and push you. Okay?

00:13:07.244 --> 00:13:08.745
You won't let go?

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:10.246
- No.
- You swear?

00:13:10.456 --> 00:13:11.706
I swear.

00:13:13.542 --> 00:13:15.376
- Okay.
- Come on.

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:21.216
- Here we go. All right? All right?
- All right.

00:13:21.425 --> 00:13:23.426
Feel good?
All right, try pedaling.

00:13:23.636 --> 00:13:26.805
That's it, you're doing great.
Yes, take control.

00:13:27.014 --> 00:13:29.307
- Yes, yes, yes.
- Whee! Hey!

00:13:30.476 --> 00:13:31.518
Oh, oh!

00:13:31.685 --> 00:13:33.520
Oh, no.

00:13:35.272 --> 00:13:36.564
You swore.

00:13:36.774 --> 00:13:41.444
- I just thought you were doing so well.
- I am shocked. Shocked.

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:48.535
It's a legitimate learning technique.

00:13:49.703 --> 00:13:51.037
Wow.

00:13:58.337 --> 00:13:59.379
Hey.

00:13:59.588 --> 00:14:03.967
There's, uh, some people outside
asking about candy.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:07.512
They're just gonna have to wait,
aren't they? I only got two hands.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:11.057
- Need some help?
- No, you don't know the system.

00:14:11.267 --> 00:14:13.768
I don't need nobody messing
with the system.

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:18.690
By the way, the week before your wedding,
you may not see a lot of me.

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:31.035
Oh, hello, liar.

00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:37.500
Look, I'm really sorry I let go of the bike.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.752
I could've been killed, I hope you know.

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.506
I know, I know.

00:14:45.259 --> 00:14:47.385
But can we please try it again?

00:14:47.636 --> 00:14:49.971
I mean, you were so close, Phoebe.

00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.765
Well, I would love to...

00:14:53.517 --> 00:14:56.769
...but the bike got stolen
and the police have no suspects.

00:15:03.193 --> 00:15:04.485
- Phoebe.
- What?

00:15:07.573 --> 00:15:09.449
What the hell?

00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:11.993
All right, you know what?

00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:15.330
If you are not going to learn
how to ride this bike, then I'm sorry...

00:15:15.539 --> 00:15:17.707
...I'm just gonna have to take it back.
- What? Why?

00:15:17.875 --> 00:15:21.127
Because. Because it's...

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:25.423
It'd be like you having this guitar...

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:27.425
...and never playing it.

00:15:27.676 --> 00:15:30.553
Okay, this guitar wants to be played.

00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:33.890
And this bike wants to be ridden.

00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:36.392
And if you don't ride it...

00:15:36.644 --> 00:15:40.688
...you're killing its spirit.

00:15:42.691 --> 00:15:43.983
The bike...

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.569
...is dying.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:55.119
All right. If you care enough
to make up that load of crap, okay.

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:56.996
Great.

00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:01.626
You're making the bike very happy.

00:16:01.835 --> 00:16:03.086
Okay, Ross.

00:16:06.006 --> 00:16:07.840
Please don't die.

00:16:11.428 --> 00:16:14.013
Okay, I think we can get the evaluation back
before they see it.

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:18.685
We have to get into Mr. Zelner's office.
He doesn't get in until 10, so no problem.

00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:22.939
But his assistant, Betty, comes in early
to eat her breakfast at her desk.

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:26.401
- That's kind of sad.
- Yeah, well, Betty's kind of sad.

00:16:26.819 --> 00:16:30.571
Which is why I believe I can lure her away
with these chocolates.

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:34.200
Now, while I distract her,
you go in the office.

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.785
- Got it.
- Let's roll.

00:16:37.496 --> 00:16:39.706
Hello, Rachel. You, uh, got a minute?

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:43.251
Yeah, sure, Mr. Zelner.
For you? Anything. Minute.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.294
Okay, great.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:47.130
Abort the plan. Abort the plan.

00:16:47.923 --> 00:16:50.591
Uh, actually,
I'd like to speak to both of you.

00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:52.260
Okay.

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:57.849
Uh, well, can we get you anything,
Mr. Zelner? Maybe some chocolates?

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:02.145
Um, no, thanks,
but I'll give these to Betty.

00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:06.858
So I read your evaluation of Tag.

00:17:07.109 --> 00:17:10.445
Or, uh, to use his full name,
Tag "Sweet Cheeks" Jones?

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.365
Is something going on with you two?

00:17:15.909 --> 00:17:19.996
Oh, my God,
can you imagine if there was?

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:25.334
I mean, what would happen exactly?

00:17:26.503 --> 00:17:29.005
Well, I'd be forced to file a report.

00:17:29.214 --> 00:17:31.924
I'd have to consult
with the legal department.

00:17:32.134 --> 00:17:34.677
And your future at the company
would be in jeopardy.

00:17:36.555 --> 00:17:38.139
- Well...
- Uh, Mr. Zelner...

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:41.100
...I'm the one
who filled in that evaluation.

00:17:41.268 --> 00:17:42.560
- Oh, no...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:44.812
I thought it would be funny.

00:17:46.106 --> 00:17:48.983
You wrote that you have a cute tushy?

00:17:50.527 --> 00:17:51.569
Yes.

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:54.238
I have a weird sense of humor.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:56.991
And I'm kind of strangely
proud of my butt.

00:17:58.452 --> 00:18:00.661
It's kind of a risky joke, Tag.

00:18:01.288 --> 00:18:03.998
And what is this drawing?
I can't figure out what this is.

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:07.543
You're looking at it upside down...
You know what? It doesn't matter.

00:18:08.962 --> 00:18:11.464
Hey, it's not like I don't have
a sense of humor, huh?

00:18:11.673 --> 00:18:15.259
Hell, I even enjoy a naughty limerick
every now and then.

00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:19.514
But there's a time and a place, huh?

00:18:21.517 --> 00:18:24.227
Unless you, uh,
have a limerick right now.

00:18:26.814 --> 00:18:30.566
No? Okay.
Well, uh, you've got my fax number.

00:18:38.617 --> 00:18:41.202
I can't believe you did that.
That was really sweet.

00:18:41.411 --> 00:18:44.288
- Ah, don't worry about it.
- No, you could've lost your job.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.750
Are you kidding me?
With a cute butt like this, I'd find work.

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:51.921
Thank you, you're great.

00:18:54.007 --> 00:18:55.925
- You know what?
- What?

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.010
I feel great.

00:18:58.637 --> 00:19:00.513
In fact...

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:06.269
What?

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:10.857
It's just... It took me so long
to get that desk organized.

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:13.025
I'm sorry.

00:19:14.153 --> 00:19:16.070
There it is.

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.167
What is going on?

00:19:29.376 --> 00:19:32.753
We're waiting for the candy.
Bring out the candy.

00:19:32.963 --> 00:19:35.339
Yeah, lady, give us candy.

00:19:36.884 --> 00:19:37.925
Joey.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:41.012
- What's up, buddy?
- What are you doing?

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:44.307
Waiting to get candy.

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:46.601
Get in here.

00:19:46.894 --> 00:19:50.354
Hey, and you cannot smoke in here.

00:19:53.859 --> 00:19:55.234
Merry Christmas.

00:19:56.445 --> 00:20:00.656
Okay, guys, the candy is coming. I just
need 15 minutes for the chocolate to cool.

00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:06.829
All right, everybody, just be quiet.
Be quiet. Be quiet. Pipe down.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:09.165
What is the matter with you people?

00:20:09.374 --> 00:20:12.501
This woman was trying to do
a nice thing for you.

00:20:12.711 --> 00:20:16.172
She was making candy so she could
try to get to know all of you...

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:19.842
...and I'll bet that not one of you
can tell me her name.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:21.510
Am I right?

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.096
Candy Lady?

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:27.725
No, not "Candy Lady."

00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:30.853
If we know it, can we have candy?

00:20:32.022 --> 00:20:33.773
All right, you know what?

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:36.525
Forget it. All of you, forget it.
You've ruined it.

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.778
Go home. You've ruined it.
You've ruined it.

00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:42.740
That's all wrong. You guys
ruined everything. You ruined it.

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:52.124
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:55.294
Did you smoke?

00:20:55.963 --> 00:21:01.384
No, smokes-a-lot lady blew smoke
directly into my mouth.

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:03.761
Uh, are you okay?

00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:06.597
I'm fine now, but it was
really scary there for a while.

00:21:06.807 --> 00:21:09.892
Someone slipped a threatening note
under the door.

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:14.021
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.
Mob mentality or whatever. I don't know.

00:21:24.783 --> 00:21:27.910
I can't believe it. I did it.
I rode a bike.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.247
I never thought I'd be able to do that.
Thank you, Ross.

00:21:31.456 --> 00:21:33.791
Oh, hey, don't thank me.
Thank yourself.

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:37.837
You're the one who faced your fears
and ultimately overcame them.

00:21:38.046 --> 00:21:41.924
Don't be so corny, Ross.
It's not an After School Special.
