00:00:03.158 --> 00:00:07.036
Ross, Mon, is it okay if I bring someone
to your parents' anniversary party?

00:00:07.287 --> 00:00:08.329
- Sure.
- Yeah.

00:00:08.496 --> 00:00:11.791
- Who's the guy?
- Parker, I met him at the dry cleaners.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:15.170
Did he put a little starch
in your bloomers?

00:00:17.797 --> 00:00:19.799
Who said that?

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:25.054
No, he's really great, though.
He has this incredible zest for life.

00:00:25.346 --> 00:00:27.015
And he treats me like a queen.

00:00:27.182 --> 00:00:30.143
Except at night, when he treats me
like the naughty girl I am.

00:00:32.312 --> 00:00:35.190
Oh, by the way, would it be okay
if I give the toast this year?

00:00:35.523 --> 00:00:38.318
Are you sure you want to
after what happened at their 20th?

00:00:38.526 --> 00:00:43.031
- Yeah, I'd really like to.
- Hopefully this time Mom won't boo you.

00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:48.661
Yes. Every year Ross makes the toast,
and it always makes them cry.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.542
- This year, I'm gonna make them cry.
- You wonder why Ross is their favorite?

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:59.881
No, really, any time Ross makes a toast,
everyone cries and pats him on the back.

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:04.802
And they all come up to me and say,
"God, your brother."

00:01:05.053 --> 00:01:09.390
You know what they're gonna say
this year? "God, you."

00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:13.895
Well, I can promise you,
at least one person will be crying.

00:01:14.062 --> 00:01:18.316
I'm an actor, and any actor
worth his salt can cry on cue.

00:01:18.525 --> 00:01:22.570
- Really? You can do that?
- Oh, you kidding me? Watch.

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:35.917
Well, I can't do it
with you guys watching me.

00:02:16.416 --> 00:02:19.794
- What are you doing?
- I'm working on my toast for the party.

00:02:19.961 --> 00:02:23.464
Or as I like to call it:
"Sob-fest 2002."

00:02:24.674 --> 00:02:26.884
- Hey, check this out.
- It's a dog.

00:02:27.093 --> 00:02:29.637
It's a dead dog.

00:02:29.887 --> 00:02:32.807
That's Chi-Chi.
She died when I was in high school.

00:02:33.016 --> 00:02:36.936
- You're gonna talk about their dead pet?
- It's good stuff, huh?

00:02:39.147 --> 00:02:40.648
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:43.985
Joey? You got a present for my parents?
That's so sweet.

00:02:44.152 --> 00:02:48.072
Yeah. In honor of their 35th anniversary,
I had a star named after them.

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.324
Aw.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.413
- That is so cool.
- And I got them Kama Sutra for the Elderly.

00:02:56.122 --> 00:02:58.958
- Do you guys have any extra ribbon?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

00:02:59.167 --> 00:03:05.673
What do you need? We got, uh, lace,
satin, sateen, raffia, gingham, felt...

00:03:06.674 --> 00:03:09.552
And I think my testicles
may be in here too.

00:03:11.846 --> 00:03:17.852
AW. Chi-Chi. Oh, I loved this dog.

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.649
You know, uh, Monica couldn't get braces
because Chi-Chi needed knee surgery.

00:03:23.816 --> 00:03:28.863
- What?
- You were the 200-pounder who rode her.

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:36.037
Hey. Everybody, this is Parker.
Parker, this is...

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:41.250
No, wait, don't tell me. Let me guess:
Joey, Monica, Ross, Rachel...

00:03:41.501 --> 00:03:43.503
...and I'm sorry,
Phoebe didn't mention you.

00:03:45.838 --> 00:03:49.258
Chandler, I'm kidding.
Already you're my favorite.

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:54.389
- Tell me a little about yourselves.
- Uh, actually, we should get going.

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.767
Classic Ross.

00:04:00.395 --> 00:04:03.898
Rachel, Rachel, look how you glow.
May I?

00:04:04.524 --> 00:04:06.484
I think you already are.

00:04:06.693 --> 00:04:10.113
Rachel, you have life
growing inside you.

00:04:10.571 --> 00:04:16.035
Is there anything more miraculous...
Ooh, a picture of a dog. Whose is this?

00:04:17.704 --> 00:04:20.748
That's my old dog.
He passed away years ago.

00:04:20.998 --> 00:04:27.088
Well, at least you were lucky to have him.
Bow-wow, old friend. Bow-wow.

00:04:29.257 --> 00:04:32.593
- So where's the party?
- Out on the island. It's in Massapequa.

00:04:32.885 --> 00:04:38.558
Massapequa, it sounds magical.
Is it steeped in Native American history?

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:40.977
Well, there is an Arby's
in the shape of a tepee.

00:04:42.562 --> 00:04:45.231
- I've got my notes. You got the presents?
- Yeah.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.275
- I've got the car keys.
- We're driving?

00:04:47.442 --> 00:04:49.444
- Yeah.
- Aces.

00:04:52.238 --> 00:04:56.409
- So, uh, he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah. Yeah, I like him a lot.

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:01.581
- You want to hang back and take a cab?
- Okay, otherwise I'm not going.

00:05:06.627 --> 00:05:09.922
- Oh.
- Hey.

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:13.468
- Hey, Mom.
- This is such a great party.

00:05:13.843 --> 00:05:18.806
Thirty-five years. Very impressive.
Do you guys have any pearls of wisdom?

00:05:19.307 --> 00:05:23.561
- Jack?
- Why serve food on such a sharp stick?

00:05:24.312 --> 00:05:27.815
It's a good question, Dad.
It's a good question.

00:05:29.567 --> 00:05:33.946
- Congratulations, you two.
- Thank you, we're so excited.

00:05:34.155 --> 00:05:36.574
And also, congratulations
on your wedding.

00:05:37.408 --> 00:05:38.576
What?

00:05:38.743 --> 00:05:42.663
- Can we talk to you for just a moment?
- Yeah.

00:05:44.207 --> 00:05:45.958
It's just a little thing.

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:50.838
While we think it's simply marvelous that
you're having this baby out of wedlock...

00:05:52.632 --> 00:05:55.510
...some of our friends
are less open-minded.

00:05:55.718 --> 00:05:58.304
- Which is why we told them you're married.
- What?

00:05:58.513 --> 00:06:01.015
Thanks for going along with this.

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:06.521
- We have to pretend that we're married?
- Son, I had to shave my ears for tonight.

00:06:06.687 --> 00:06:08.022
You can do this.

00:06:09.732 --> 00:06:11.859
- Can you believe that?
- I know.

00:06:12.151 --> 00:06:16.489
If you're gonna do the ears, you may
as well take a pass at the nose area.

00:06:16.697 --> 00:06:19.992
No, no, I don't want to have to lie
about us being married.

00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:24.121
I know. I don't either.
But it's their party, and it's one night.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.874
We don't even have to lie.
We just won't say anything.

00:06:27.124 --> 00:06:30.419
If it comes up, we'll smile,
we'll nod along...

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:31.712
- Ross?
- Rachel?

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:35.216
Hi, Aunt Lisa. Uncle Dan.

00:06:35.383 --> 00:06:40.346
Congratulations on the baby
and on the wedding.

00:06:41.722 --> 00:06:46.227
- Here's something to get you started.
- So how's marriage treating you?

00:06:46.853 --> 00:06:50.022
- Unbelievable. It's great.
- I love marriage.

00:06:50.231 --> 00:06:51.649
We'll see you later.

00:06:51.858 --> 00:06:54.068
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:06:54.902 --> 00:06:57.905
What a beautiful place.
What a great night.

00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:02.410
I have to tell you, being here
with all of you in Event Room C...

00:07:04.412 --> 00:07:08.791
...I feel so lucky. To think of all the
good times that have happened here.

00:07:08.958 --> 00:07:14.088
The birthdays, the proms,
the mitzvahs, both bar and bat.

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:19.260
But none of it will compare with tonight.
My God, I don't want to forget this moment.

00:07:19.427 --> 00:07:23.639
It's like I want to take a mental
picture of you all. Click.

00:07:25.474 --> 00:07:28.603
I don't think the flash went off.

00:07:31.981 --> 00:07:34.567
- I'm gonna go find the men's room.
- I'll go with you.

00:07:34.734 --> 00:07:37.153
Somewhere, there is someone
with a tranquilizer gun...

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:40.072
...and a huge butterfly net
looking for that man.

00:07:41.616 --> 00:07:46.454
I have to go too, but I don't
want him complimenting my thing.

00:07:46.704 --> 00:07:49.498
I'm so glad we weren't in the car.
Did he ever let up?

00:07:49.749 --> 00:07:54.003
He called the Long Island Expressway
a concrete miracle.

00:07:54.587 --> 00:07:57.465
This room. This night.

00:07:57.757 --> 00:08:03.638
That waiter. His shoes.
I must take a mental picture.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.473
Sorry.

00:08:09.143 --> 00:08:11.437
Were you guys making fun of Parker?

00:08:12.813 --> 00:08:15.608
That depends, how much did you hear?

00:08:17.443 --> 00:08:20.279
Well, he's a little enthusiastic.
What's wrong with that?

00:08:20.446 --> 00:08:24.325
- It's just... It's so much.
- Well, so what? I like him.

00:08:24.492 --> 00:08:28.663
Do I make fun of the people you've dated?
Tag, Janice, Mona.

00:08:28.955 --> 00:08:33.292
No, because friends don't do that.
But do you want my opinion?

00:08:33.459 --> 00:08:38.798
In my opinion, your collective dating record
reads like a who's who of human crap.

00:08:41.467 --> 00:08:44.762
- I feel terrible.
- I know.

00:08:45.846 --> 00:08:47.765
What was wrong with Mona?

00:08:53.354 --> 00:08:56.023
- Open it, open it, open it.
- Yeah, baby.

00:08:56.273 --> 00:09:00.152
So we never got to hear
about your wedding.

00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:05.282
- We were surprised we weren't invited.
- Oh, no, it was just our parents.

00:09:05.449 --> 00:09:06.534
It was a small wedding.

00:09:06.701 --> 00:09:11.372
But it was beautiful.
It was small, but kind of spectacular.

00:09:11.539 --> 00:09:16.377
- Where did you have it?
- On a cliff in Barbados, at sunset.

00:09:16.627 --> 00:09:20.715
And Stevie Wonder sang "isn't She Lovely"
as I walked down the aisle.

00:09:20.881 --> 00:09:21.882
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:09:22.049 --> 00:09:26.053
- Stevie's an old family friend.
- Oh, my God. That sounds amazing.

00:09:26.303 --> 00:09:30.057
- I'd love to see pictures.
- Yeah, so would I.

00:09:30.307 --> 00:09:35.855
You wouldn't think that Annie Leibovitz
would forget to put film in the camera.

00:09:37.231 --> 00:09:39.692
Would you excuse us for a second?

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.406
- Um, what are you doing?
- What? I'm not you.

00:09:45.573 --> 00:09:47.408
This may be the only wedding
leverhave.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:53.539
- And I want it to be amazing.
- Okay. Okay. Ooh. Ooh.

00:09:53.706 --> 00:09:58.002
- Maybe I rode in on a Harley.
- Okay, Ross, it has to be realistic.

00:10:03.049 --> 00:10:07.178
Say, uh, ahem, are you okay?
You seem kind of quiet.

00:10:07.386 --> 00:10:11.015
- No, I'm fine. I'm great. I'm with you.
- And I'm with you.

00:10:11.182 --> 00:10:13.100
What a great time to be alive.

00:10:14.602 --> 00:10:17.563
Look at this plate bouncy thing.

00:10:18.606 --> 00:10:21.192
What an inspired solution to man's
plate-dispensing problems.

00:10:21.358 --> 00:10:22.693
Mm-hm. Yeah.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:26.864
- Ah. Oysters. Let me feed you one.
- That's not necessary.

00:10:27.073 --> 00:10:28.574
- Please?
- No, actually, I don't eat...

00:10:28.783 --> 00:10:32.119
- I won't quit until you try one.
- Okay, fine, fine.

00:10:33.454 --> 00:10:37.875
- Mm. Mm-hm. Good.
- What're they like? I've never had one.

00:10:39.877 --> 00:10:42.213
- Why don't you just try one?
- Nah, they look too weird.

00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:48.010
- What are you doing?
- Just going over my toast.

00:10:48.177 --> 00:10:50.346
Ah, those two will never know
what hit them.

00:10:50.513 --> 00:10:55.643
I can't wait. They're gonna cry so hard,
they'll be fighting for breath.

00:10:56.018 --> 00:10:59.730
You know, if you want to, I could just
hold them down and you could just:

00:11:01.607 --> 00:11:06.654
And my veil was lace,
made by blind Belgian nuns.

00:11:06.904 --> 00:11:10.324
- Blind?
- Well, not at first, but it was intricate work.

00:11:10.616 --> 00:11:14.829
And they said even though they lost
their sight, it was all worth it.

00:11:15.287 --> 00:11:18.666
- I bet you looked beautiful.
- Oh, well, I don't know about that.

00:11:18.916 --> 00:11:22.503
But there were some people that said
I looked like a floating angel.

00:11:24.296 --> 00:11:28.926
- How did you propose?
- Oh, yeah, that's a great story.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:34.181
Well, um, actually,
I took her to the planetarium.

00:11:34.598 --> 00:11:37.351
That's where we had our first date.

00:11:37.518 --> 00:11:43.190
Um, she walked in, and I had the room
filled with, uh, lilies, her favorite flower.

00:11:43.858 --> 00:11:47.653
- That is so sweet.
- Shh. I want to hear the rest.

00:11:49.196 --> 00:11:52.867
Then Fred Astaire singing, uh,
"The Way You Look Tonight"...

00:11:53.033 --> 00:11:55.953
...came on the sound system
and the lights came down...

00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.288
...and I got on one knee...

00:11:57.538 --> 00:12:01.876
...and written across the dome,
in the stars, were the words:

00:12:02.126 --> 00:12:03.377
"Will you marry me?"

00:12:03.544 --> 00:12:05.212
Aw.

00:12:05.671 --> 00:12:09.717
And the ring was the size of my fist.

00:12:11.093 --> 00:12:14.346
Hey, uh, Phoebe? Look, uh...

00:12:15.890 --> 00:12:19.560
...I want to apologize about before, okay?
We were being jerks.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.438
Parker's a nice guy,
and I'd like to get to know him.

00:12:22.605 --> 00:12:23.856
Then you better do it now.

00:12:24.064 --> 00:12:26.525
- Why?
- Because I'm gonna kill him.

00:12:26.734 --> 00:12:28.444
- What?
- You guys were right.

00:12:28.611 --> 00:12:31.405
He's just too excited
about everything.

00:12:31.655 --> 00:12:36.035
I mean, I'm all for living life, but this is
the Gellers' 35th anniversary.

00:12:36.243 --> 00:12:38.704
Let's call a spade a spade.
This party stinks.

00:12:39.413 --> 00:12:41.415
I know. I'm having the worst time.

00:12:41.582 --> 00:12:45.753
There was a 15-minute line for the buffet,
and when I finally got up to the plates...

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.173
...I slipped on a giant booger.

00:12:51.258 --> 00:12:54.428
Are you sure it wasn't an oyster?

00:12:55.262 --> 00:12:58.140
I guess it could've been.
I didn't really look at it.

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:02.353
I just wiped it on Chandler's coat
and got the hell out of there.

00:13:02.603 --> 00:13:06.523
I just thought he was such a great guy.
I was so excited about him.

00:13:06.732 --> 00:13:10.152
Well, hey, you should
be excited about him.

00:13:10.402 --> 00:13:12.738
There's nothing wrong with him.
He's a good guy.

00:13:12.947 --> 00:13:14.949
- You think?
- Yeah, know what I think?

00:13:15.157 --> 00:13:18.911
- We were all just being too negative.
- You're right.

00:13:19.161 --> 00:13:24.208
You're right. He's just embracing life.
We could all stand to be more like Parker.

00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:27.962
You know what? I am like him.
I'm a sunny, positive person.

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.465
- Actually, you have a little bit of an edge.
- What's that now?

00:13:33.592 --> 00:13:36.303
- Oh, it's Parker.
- Look, the Bunny Hop.

00:13:36.595 --> 00:13:38.222
- Oh, I love it.
- You do?

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:43.143
Are you kidding? People acting
like animals to music? Come on.

00:13:45.062 --> 00:13:47.773
Okay, it's time for the toast.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.944
I know that normally Ross gives the toast,
but this year I'm gonna do it.

00:13:54.113 --> 00:13:57.658
No, it's gonna be great. Really.

00:13:58.492 --> 00:13:59.910
Okay, um...

00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.498
Mom, Dad, when I got married...

00:14:04.748 --> 00:14:08.168
...one of the things
that made me sure that I could do it...

00:14:08.335 --> 00:14:10.796
...was the amazing example
the two of you set for me.

00:14:11.422 --> 00:14:15.092
For that, and for so many other things,
I wanna say thank you.

00:14:15.301 --> 00:14:18.887
I know I probably don't
say it enough...

00:14:19.722 --> 00:14:21.765
...but I love you.

00:14:32.651 --> 00:14:35.195
When I look around this room...

00:14:35.362 --> 00:14:39.241
...I'm saddened by the thought
of those who could not be with us.

00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:43.787
Nana, my beloved grandmother,
who would so want to be here.

00:14:45.205 --> 00:14:47.041
But she can't...

00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:48.876
...because she's dead.

00:14:52.713 --> 00:14:55.632
As is our dog, Chi-Chi.

00:14:57.676 --> 00:15:00.679
I mean, look how cute she is... Was.

00:15:03.265 --> 00:15:05.851
Do me a favor,
pass this to my parents.

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:11.148
Remember, um, she's dead, okay?
Her and Nana, gone.

00:15:14.985 --> 00:15:16.820
Wow.

00:15:19.239 --> 00:15:20.783
Um...

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:23.577
Hey, does anybody remember when...

00:15:23.869 --> 00:15:29.416
...Debra Winger had to say goodbye
to her children in Terms of Endearment?

00:15:30.876 --> 00:15:32.378
Didn't see that?

00:15:33.295 --> 00:15:35.839
No movie fans?

00:15:37.591 --> 00:15:39.593
You want to hear something sad?

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.595
Um, the other day
I was watching 60 Minutes...

00:15:41.762 --> 00:15:44.264
...and there was this piece
on these orphans in Romania...

00:15:44.515 --> 00:15:48.310
...who have been so neglected
that they were incapable of love.

00:15:54.942 --> 00:15:58.320
You people are made of stone.

00:15:58.529 --> 00:16:00.781
Here's to Mom and Dad. Whatever.

00:16:08.205 --> 00:16:11.708
Thank you, Monica.
That was, uh, interesting.

00:16:11.959 --> 00:16:15.921
- Wasn't it interesting, Jack?
- Why don't I remember this dog?

00:16:19.299 --> 00:16:22.219
Ross? Why don't you give us
your toast now?

00:16:22.428 --> 00:16:25.514
Oh, no, Mom.
It's just Monica this year.

00:16:26.557 --> 00:16:30.936
You're not gonna say anything?
On our 35th wedding anniversary?

00:16:32.396 --> 00:16:34.148
No, of course, um...

00:16:36.358 --> 00:16:41.905
Um, everybody?
Um, ahem, I just wanted to say...

00:16:42.072 --> 00:16:45.951
...uh, on behalf of my new bride,
Rachel...

00:16:49.246 --> 00:16:53.167
...and myself, um, that if...

00:16:53.876 --> 00:16:59.339
If in 35 years,
we're half as happy as you guys are...

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:02.634
...we'll count ourselves
the luckiest people in the world.

00:17:04.303 --> 00:17:06.263
Oh, Ross.

00:17:09.308 --> 00:17:13.937
I just wish Nana were alive
to hear Ross' toast.

00:17:20.527 --> 00:17:23.947
My God, what a fantastically
well-lit hallway.

00:17:25.407 --> 00:17:29.620
Can I, um, get you something to drink,
like a water and Valium?

00:17:30.787 --> 00:17:35.000
I must say, this apartment,
it's... there are no words.

00:17:35.209 --> 00:17:37.836
- Oh, thank God.
- It's a haven.

00:17:38.045 --> 00:17:43.383
- A third-floor paradise, a modern-day Eden.
- Yeah, I know, I know. Uh-huh. Gotcha.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:50.015
Listen, why don't we just, um, sit and relax,
you know, just be with each other quietly.

00:17:50.641 --> 00:17:52.559
- That sounds great.
- Uh-huh.

00:17:53.393 --> 00:17:57.314
My God, this is the most comfortable couch
I've ever sat on in my entire life.

00:17:57.564 --> 00:18:00.442
Let's try something else.
Let's play a game.

00:18:00.651 --> 00:18:03.445
- I love games.
- Shocking.

00:18:03.612 --> 00:18:07.407
Um, let's play the game of...

00:18:08.033 --> 00:18:10.327
...who can stay quiet the longest.

00:18:12.246 --> 00:18:13.747
Or Jenga.

00:18:14.957 --> 00:18:20.128
Let's play this one first, and remember,
whoever talks first loses.

00:18:24.758 --> 00:18:29.263
- I lose, now Jenga.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:18:30.264 --> 00:18:33.517
- Is something wrong?
- Wrong? You know the word "wrong"?

00:18:33.684 --> 00:18:36.270
Everything isn't perfect?
Everything isn't magical?

00:18:36.562 --> 00:18:40.274
Everything isn't aglow
with the light of a million fairies?

00:18:40.524 --> 00:18:42.776
They were just brake lights, Parker.

00:18:42.943 --> 00:18:47.030
Well, excuse me for putting
a good spin on a traffic jam.

00:18:47.781 --> 00:18:51.034
But you don't have to put
a good spin on everything.

00:18:51.243 --> 00:18:54.288
I'm sorry. That's who I am.
I'm a positive person.

00:18:54.454 --> 00:18:55.998
No, I'm a positive person.

00:18:56.248 --> 00:19:00.377
You are like Santa Claus on Prozac.

00:19:00.627 --> 00:19:04.256
At Disneyland, getting laid.

00:19:05.215 --> 00:19:07.801
So, what do you want me to do?
You want me to be more negative?

00:19:07.968 --> 00:19:11.555
- You want me to be less happy?
- Much less happy.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:15.892
Fine. Well, then to quote Ross,
"I better be going."

00:19:17.811 --> 00:19:19.313
So long.

00:19:19.479 --> 00:19:24.484
Hey. Don't let the best door in the world
hit you in the ass on your way out.

00:19:29.323 --> 00:19:33.952
Isn't this the most incredible fight
you've ever had in your entire life?

00:19:36.622 --> 00:19:42.794
We could've gone from the ceremony
to the reception with you in the sidecar.

00:19:43.003 --> 00:19:44.838
Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible.

00:19:45.088 --> 00:19:49.593
But having a dove place the ring
on your finger would've been no problem.

00:19:52.137 --> 00:19:54.056
It was really fun
being married to you tonight.

00:19:54.222 --> 00:19:57.351
Yeah, and it was the easiest 400 bucks
I ever made.

00:19:58.935 --> 00:20:02.439
- Okay, Ross, can I, um, ask you something?
- Yeah.

00:20:02.689 --> 00:20:07.319
- That proposal at the planetarium?
- I know, I know. It was stupid.

00:20:07.527 --> 00:20:13.450
Are you kidding? With the lilies,
and the song and the stars?

00:20:13.617 --> 00:20:18.705
It was really wonderful.
Did you just make that up?

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:22.167
Uh, no, actually, I thought about it
when we were going out.

00:20:22.376 --> 00:20:27.130
That's how I imagined
I, uh, would ask you to marry me.

00:20:28.048 --> 00:20:29.633
Wow.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:35.055
Well, that would've been, uh,
very hard to say no to.

00:20:38.016 --> 00:20:39.685
Well, it's a good thing I didn't do it...

00:20:39.851 --> 00:20:43.480
...because it sounds like it would have been
a very expensive wedding.

00:20:49.695 --> 00:20:53.407
- Okay, good night.
- Good night.

00:20:55.909 --> 00:21:00.664
Uh, even if the sidecar had a windscreen
so your hair wouldn't get messed up?

00:21:00.872 --> 00:21:04.209
- I will think about it.
- That's all I'm asking.

00:21:07.921 --> 00:21:10.215
Okay, that's it. I give up.

00:21:10.424 --> 00:21:14.094
At Mom and Dad's 40th anniversary,
you're the one giving the speech.

00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:18.014
You know, I don't understand why
they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.

00:21:18.223 --> 00:21:21.309
- Oh, come on.
- Hey. That stuff you said about true love?

00:21:21.601 --> 00:21:26.106
You were right. I mean,
we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad.

00:21:26.314 --> 00:21:30.026
And that picture of Chi-Chi
with her mischievous grin.

00:21:30.277 --> 00:21:31.862
And what you said about Nana?

00:21:32.028 --> 00:21:36.700
Oh, yeah, she really would've
wanted to be there.

00:21:37.159 --> 00:21:39.619
And you know what?

00:21:40.704 --> 00:21:42.831
I think she was.

00:21:44.291 --> 00:21:47.961
Oh, good God, Ross,
how the hell do you do it'?
