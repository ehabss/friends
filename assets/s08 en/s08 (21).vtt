00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.048
- Hey, guys. I got some bad news.
- What?

00:00:06.215 --> 00:00:11.554
That's no way to sell newspapers.
Try, "Extra! Extra! Read all about it!"

00:00:11.721 --> 00:00:16.017
No. Monica's restaurant got a horrible
review in the Post.

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:17.309
Oh, no!

00:00:17.476 --> 00:00:22.606
I didn't want her to see it, so I ran around
and bought all the copies I could find.

00:00:22.773 --> 00:00:26.569
Man, this is bad.
And I've had my share of bad reviews.

00:00:26.736 --> 00:00:28.404
I still remember my first good one:

00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:31.991
"Everything else in this production
of Our Town was simply terrible.

00:00:32.158 --> 00:00:35.161
Joey Tribbiani was abysmal."

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.206
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:00:39.373 --> 00:00:41.542
Oh, my God!
Look at all the newspapers.

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:44.670
It must be a good review. Is it great?

00:00:44.837 --> 00:00:46.630
Um...

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:51.010
Oh, dear God.

00:00:51.177 --> 00:00:55.139
But the good news is, no one
in a two-block radius will ever know.

00:00:56.891 --> 00:01:00.227
- What about the rest of Manhattan?
- Yeah, they all know.

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:03.439
- Oh, my God, this is horrible.
- I'm sorry.

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:05.024
I'm so humiliated.

00:01:05.191 --> 00:01:08.778
But you know what they say,
there is no such thing as bad press.

00:01:08.944 --> 00:01:14.408
You don't think that, um, "the chef's
mahi-mahi was awful-awful" is bad press?

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:18.370
I didn't write it.

00:01:18.537 --> 00:01:22.458
- God, is he right? Am I awful?
- Oh, no!

00:01:22.625 --> 00:01:24.210
Hey, Monica, listen to me, okay?

00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:27.713
I'm not saying this because I'm your friend,
I say it because it's true.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.216
Your food is abysmal!

00:02:15.094 --> 00:02:17.972
- Ross?
- What? What?

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:21.892
- I am freaking out!
- Are you?

00:02:22.434 --> 00:02:24.645
My due date is in one week!

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:27.731
- What are you doing up?
- That is seven days.

00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:31.068
Look, I had a lot of water.
Can we do this after...?

00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:33.154
No, no, no, no, Ross!

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.990
Please, come on.
We do not have any big stuff we need.

00:02:36.157 --> 00:02:39.451
We don't have a changing table.
We do not have a crib.

00:02:39.618 --> 00:02:43.664
- We do not have a diaper service.
- Funny you should mention diapers.

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:47.751
- I'm serious.
- Look. There's nothing to worry about.

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:51.463
We have plenty of time.
There's a baby furniture store on West 10th.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.048
Tomorrow, we'll go there...

00:02:53.215 --> 00:02:57.928
- ...and we'll get everything we need. Okay?
- Okay. Thank you. That's great.

00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:01.182
Wait, where on West 10th?
There's a really cute shoe store...

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:04.101
Okay. If, uh... If you're gonna do this...

00:03:04.268 --> 00:03:06.061
...then I'm gonna go do that, so...

00:03:06.228 --> 00:03:09.899
- Wait, Ross! I'm sorry, one more thing.
- Yeah.

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:14.195
Um, our situation, you know, um,
what we mean to each other...

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:19.825
...and, I mean, we're having this baby
together and we live together...

00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:22.578
Isn't that...? Isn't that weird?

00:03:28.792 --> 00:03:30.127
Well, uh...

00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:33.088
- I'm just kidding. You can go pee. Ha, ha.
- Oh...!

00:03:37.343 --> 00:03:40.137
Hey, I can't remember.
Did we say we were gonna meet here...

00:03:40.304 --> 00:03:41.972
- ...or at the movie?
- At the movies...

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:46.018
- I'll see you there.
- Joey. Now that you're here...?

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:49.188
Sure, I can hang out
till I have to meet you.

00:03:50.105 --> 00:03:53.817
- How come you're not going?
- I've got a job interview to get ready for.

00:03:53.984 --> 00:03:58.948
- I thought you already have a job.
- And people say you don't pay attention.

00:03:59.114 --> 00:04:02.076
This is a much better job.
It's vice president of the company...

00:04:02.243 --> 00:04:03.911
...that does data reconfiguration...

00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:06.580
...and statistical factoring
and for other companies.

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:13.420
- Wow. How do you know how to do that?
- That's what I do now.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.924
- Joey? Come taste this.
- What is it?

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:20.552
Remember the guy that gave me
a bad review? Well...

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.264
...I'm getting my revenge.

00:04:24.098 --> 00:04:26.183
You cooked him?

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.229
No. He teaches a course on food criticism
at The New School.

00:04:30.396 --> 00:04:33.816
Before we go to the movies, I want
to make him try my bouillabaisse again.

00:04:33.983 --> 00:04:37.194
Ugh, I can't wait to read the front
page tomorrow:

00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:42.199
"Restaurant reviewer admits:
'I was wrong about Monica."'

00:04:42.366 --> 00:04:44.535
The front page?

00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:47.329
You really do live in your own
little world, don't you?

00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:56.171
Do you want these delivered,
Mr. and Mrs. Geller?

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:58.716
- Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
- Heh. No, no.

00:04:58.882 --> 00:05:01.468
- We're not married.
- We are having a baby together...

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:04.054
...but we're not involved.

00:05:04.221 --> 00:05:08.517
I mean, uh, we... We were seeing
each other a while ago...

00:05:08.684 --> 00:05:12.646
...but then we were just friends,
and then there was one drunken night...

00:05:15.524 --> 00:05:18.527
Or, yes, stranger,
we'd like this delivered, please.

00:05:19.695 --> 00:05:22.865
- Why don't you fill out this address card?
- Oh, okay.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.452
- I noticed you picked out a lot of dinosaurs.
- Oh, yeah.

00:05:26.618 --> 00:05:29.204
That's one of the reasons
why we are not a couple.

00:05:30.622 --> 00:05:33.208
I chose those. I'm a paleontologist.

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.753
Really? That is so cool.

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.674
Oh, don't get too worked up over it.
It sounds like he's a doctor, but he's not.

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.303
Oh, no. I'm fascinated by paleontology.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.599
- Have you read the Walter Alvarez book?
- Yeah, heh, I teach it in class.

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:53.645
Oh, my God. Standing at a cash register,
I'm holding a credit card, and I'm bored.

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:59.109
I love your neighborhood. There's a great
gym around the corner from your building.

00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:02.154
- That's my gym.
- I could tell you work out.

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:12.831
A paleontologist who works out.
You're like Indiana Jones.

00:06:16.668 --> 00:06:18.962
I am like Indiana Jones.

00:06:25.844 --> 00:06:26.887
Hi, Pheebs.

00:06:27.054 --> 00:06:29.473
Hey! Oh, how did baby shopping go?

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.309
It was great!
We got everything we needed.

00:06:32.476 --> 00:06:35.979
Oh, and Ross almost got
something that wasn't on the list.

00:06:36.313 --> 00:06:37.856
Ahem, a whore.

00:06:40.192 --> 00:06:42.903
- What?
- We were paying for our stuff...

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:46.240
...and this sales woman
just started flirting with him.

00:06:46.407 --> 00:06:47.658
Can you believe that?

00:06:47.825 --> 00:06:51.036
- Did she know you two weren't married?
- Yeah.

00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:57.584
Oh, my God. Well, the idea...
A woman flirting with a single man?

00:06:57.751 --> 00:07:01.380
- We must alert the church elders.
- No.

00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:05.300
You don't understand.
You didn't see how brazen she was.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.679
- Sounds like you're a little jealous.
- No, I'm not.

00:07:08.846 --> 00:07:13.225
I just think it's wrong.
I mean, here I am, about to pop...

00:07:13.392 --> 00:07:17.688
...and he's out picking up
some shopgirl at Sluts-R-Us?

00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:21.400
Is that a real place?

00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:24.153
Are they hiring?

00:07:25.404 --> 00:07:28.449
- Hey, Phoebe. Fatty.
- Wha...?

00:07:29.408 --> 00:07:31.368
Hey, Chandler, why so fancy?

00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:33.620
Well, I got a job interview.
Big deal, too.

00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:37.332
It's more money. I'd be doing data
reconfiguration and statistical factoring.

00:07:37.499 --> 00:07:42.546
- I think I know someone who does that.
- Me. I do that.

00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:45.382
So seriously, do I look okay? I'm nervous.

00:07:45.549 --> 00:07:47.593
Oh, yeah. You... Really, you look great.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.429
You know, just don't get your hopes up.

00:07:51.638 --> 00:07:54.057
- Why not?
- Well, the interview.

00:07:54.224 --> 00:07:55.809
- What about it?
- You know.

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:58.645
You don't make a very good
first impression.

00:07:59.563 --> 00:08:02.608
- What?
- Oh, you don't know.

00:08:03.358 --> 00:08:06.403
- Are you serious?
- Yes. When I first met you, you were like:

00:08:07.905 --> 00:08:09.156
I was like:

00:08:09.323 --> 00:08:10.991
Shh!

00:08:13.744 --> 00:08:15.537
What is it that I do?

00:08:15.704 --> 00:08:19.249
It's just, like, you're trying too hard,
always making jokes.

00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:22.127
You just... You come off a little needy.

00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:24.588
Did you like me when we first met?

00:08:25.088 --> 00:08:27.841
Chandler, I'm not gonna lie to you.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.302
But I am gonna run away from you.

00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:38.227
Hi. I'm Monica Geller,
chef at Allessandro's.

00:08:38.393 --> 00:08:40.479
Still?

00:08:40.646 --> 00:08:42.731
I think the things you said were unfair...

00:08:42.898 --> 00:08:46.276
...and I would like you to give
my bouillabaisse another chance.

00:08:46.443 --> 00:08:49.404
I don't see any reason
why I'd do that to myself again.

00:08:49.571 --> 00:08:52.282
Either eat it or be in it.

00:08:53.283 --> 00:08:54.493
SP0on?

00:08:59.706 --> 00:09:02.292
- So, what do you think?
- I'm torn...

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:06.296
...between my integrity
and my desire to avoid a beating.

00:09:07.381 --> 00:09:11.426
But I must be honest.
Your soup is abysmal.

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:19.518
Thattagirll Eh? We should get out of here,
there's a new class coming in.

00:09:19.685 --> 00:09:22.354
Welcome to Introduction to Cooking.
Before we start...

00:09:22.521 --> 00:09:26.316
...can anyone tell me the difference
between hollandaise and béarnaise sauce?

00:09:28.902 --> 00:09:31.071
- I can.
- Okay, go ahead.

00:09:31.238 --> 00:09:34.825
Well, um, they both have a egg yolk
and butter base.

00:09:34.992 --> 00:09:39.913
But a béarnaise, um, has shallots,
chervil, and most importantly, tarragon.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.874
- Ha, ha, very good. What's your name?
- Monica.

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:47.004
- Monica, you go to the head of the class!
- Okay!

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:52.384
All this stuff takes up a lot of room.

00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:56.179
Hey, how, uh, serious are you
about keeping Ben in your life?

00:09:56.888 --> 00:09:58.807
My son? Pretty serious.

00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:09.026
Oh, hey, Katie.
What are you doing here?

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:12.029
The delivery went out
and I realized they forgot this.

00:10:12.195 --> 00:10:16.575
Ah, it must have been obvious, since it
was the only thing left in your store.

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:24.124
Listen, to be honest, home deliveries
aren't really part of my job description.

00:10:24.291 --> 00:10:25.709
Oh.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:31.340
Oh, um, I actually came here
to ask you out.

00:10:31.506 --> 00:10:35.927
Oh. Wow. Uh, yeah, that sounds great.

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:42.351
I'm just gonna put this back in my
pocket and pretend that didn't happen.

00:10:42.517 --> 00:10:45.312
Uh, I'm free now.
You want to grab some coffee...?

00:10:45.479 --> 00:10:48.732
- Sure.
- Horny bitch.

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:56.114
No, you're a horny bitch!
No, you're a horny bitch!

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:59.201
No, you're a horny bitch!

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.914
So you guys go, have a really good time.

00:11:04.081 --> 00:11:07.668
I'm just gonna grab my coat.
And, uh, my whip.

00:11:09.086 --> 00:11:10.962
You know, because of Indiana Jones.

00:11:14.132 --> 00:11:18.011
Not because I'm into S&amp;M.

00:11:18.178 --> 00:11:20.722
I'm not into anything weird,
you know? Heh.

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:23.308
Just normal sex.

00:11:26.728 --> 00:11:29.106
So I'm gonna grab my coat.

00:11:33.276 --> 00:11:39.241
So you had a good day, huh?
Big commission, picked up a daddy.

00:11:40.242 --> 00:11:42.285
Are you okay with this?

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:45.455
Oh, yeah. Yeah, please.
You guys have fun.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:47.666
- Okay. Heh.
- Yeah.

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:49.000
It was nice to see you.

00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:52.212
Oh, and it was great to see you too.
And you look fantastic.

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:55.632
- Ah, heh.
- Although you missed a button.

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.801
Oh, actually, I, um...

00:11:57.968 --> 00:12:00.095
Oh, okay, I see
what you're doing there.

00:12:03.765 --> 00:12:06.893
I can't even believe this.
I really come off that badly?

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:10.564
Ugh, it's okay. You calm down
after a while...

00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:14.234
...and then people can see
how sweet and wonderful you are.

00:12:14.401 --> 00:12:18.155
Good. Because I'm sure this
interview's gonna last a couple of weeks.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:22.659
All right, don't freak out, okay?
I will help you.

00:12:22.826 --> 00:12:26.538
- How long before you have to leave?
- An hour.

00:12:26.747 --> 00:12:29.374
- I can't help you.
- Phoebe...

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:34.963
We'll do our best. I'm the interviewer
and I'm meeting you for the first time.

00:12:35.130 --> 00:12:39.259
- Okay.
- Hi. Come on in. I'm Regina Phalanges.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:42.262
- Chandler Bing.
- Oh, Bing.

00:12:42.429 --> 00:12:46.266
- What an unusual name.
- Well, you should meet my Uncle Bada.

00:12:52.439 --> 00:12:55.066
I'll let myself out.

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.072
H93'-

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:04.409
Your alfredo's dry.
Did you use your cheese?

00:13:04.618 --> 00:13:09.790
When you say "use," do you mean
"eat as a pre-cooking snack"?

00:13:10.415 --> 00:13:13.668
- And the cream?
- Cheese makes me thirsty.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.049
- Okay. Let's move on.
- All right.

00:13:19.216 --> 00:13:24.012
Oh. Something smells good
over at Monica's station.

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:29.059
My God! This is absolutely amazing!
You've never made this before?

00:13:29.226 --> 00:13:31.561
Oh, no. I don't know anything
about cooking.

00:13:33.146 --> 00:13:37.484
I had to ask what it was called
when the water makes those bubbles.

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:39.986
Wow. Hats off to the chef.

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:43.198
I'm sorry, your mouth was full.
I didn't hear what you said.

00:13:43.365 --> 00:13:45.450
- Hats off to who now?
- The chef!

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.953
Heh, that's right!

00:13:49.788 --> 00:13:53.208
I think you'll find if I work here
that I don't micromanage.

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:55.460
I don't shy away from delegating.

00:13:55.627 --> 00:13:59.548
Mm-hm. That's good to know. But let's
stop focusing on what you don't do...

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:01.591
...and focus on what you do do.

00:14:05.846 --> 00:14:07.806
What I do do...

00:14:10.267 --> 00:14:13.436
...is manage to, uh,
create an atmosphere of support...

00:14:13.603 --> 00:14:15.230
...for the people working with me.

00:14:15.397 --> 00:14:18.066
I see. Nice sidestep on the "do do" thing.

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:21.987
- Hardest thing I've ever done in my life.
- Oh, you gotta go!

00:14:22.153 --> 00:14:24.906
- Okay, don't worry. You're ready.
- Really?

00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:28.869
Absolutely! Just fight all your
natural instincts, and you'll be great.

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.915
Ah, Monica, my star student.

00:14:34.082 --> 00:14:35.792
Heh. You called me that before...

00:14:35.959 --> 00:14:39.546
...so I took the liberty of
fashioning a star out of foil.

00:14:39.713 --> 00:14:43.008
Now, no pressure. If you like my
cookies, you give me the star.

00:14:46.511 --> 00:14:48.722
Mm. Mm-mm-mm.

00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:51.349
Wow, a star!

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:55.729
I know you all hate me,
and I'm sorry, but I don't care.

00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:59.524
- Okay, Joey, you're up next.
- Yeah.

00:15:01.943 --> 00:15:05.113
Oh, my God! This is amazing!

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:07.240
You get an A.

00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:11.995
I got an A? In school?
Hey, I'm a dork!

00:15:13.455 --> 00:15:15.582
Joey, I'm so proud of you.

00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:18.919
- I think you should give him your star.
- Excuse me?

00:15:20.503 --> 00:15:23.256
- He doesn't even know what he's doing.
- We're all beginners.

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:26.635
- Nobody knows what they're doing.
- I do. I'm a professional chef!

00:15:28.178 --> 00:15:31.139
Oh, relax. It's not a courtroom drama.

00:15:31.306 --> 00:15:34.225
What are you doing
taking Introduction to Cooking?

00:15:34.392 --> 00:15:36.102
Yeah!

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.650
I'm sorry. It's just that, um,
I cook at this restaurant, Allessandrds...

00:15:41.816 --> 00:15:43.777
...and, um, I just got
a really bad review.

00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:46.988
- Oh, Allessandro's? I love that place!
- You do?

00:15:47.155 --> 00:15:50.241
Yes, you're an excellent chef.
As a person you're a little...

00:15:50.408 --> 00:15:54.329
- Oh, totally crazy, but you liked the food?
- Ha, ha. Very much.

00:15:54.496 --> 00:15:58.416
Okay, then. I don't stink.
I'm a good chef! Okay.

00:15:58.583 --> 00:16:01.628
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I don't want to go. I'm having fun.

00:16:01.795 --> 00:16:04.381
Actually, did either of you
pay for this class?

00:16:04.547 --> 00:16:07.217
Hey, if my friend says
it's time to go, it's time to go!

00:16:16.059 --> 00:16:18.853
Also, I was the point person
on my company's transition...

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.731
...from the KL5 to GR6 systems.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.319
- You must have had your hands full.
- That I did. That I did.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.572
So let's talk a little bit
about your duties.

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:36.121
My duties?

00:16:39.791 --> 00:16:40.917
All right.

00:16:41.126 --> 00:16:44.337
You'll be heading a whole division,
so you'll have a lot of duties.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.886
- I see.
- But there'll be 30 people under you...

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:54.514
...so you can dump
a certain amount on them.

00:16:59.477 --> 00:17:02.647
- Good to know.
- We could go into detail...

00:17:02.856 --> 00:17:04.858
No, don't, I beg of you.

00:17:05.025 --> 00:17:08.903
All right, then. We'll have a definite
answer for you on Monday.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:13.324
But I can say with some
confidence, you'll fit in well here.

00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.536
- Really?
- Absolutely.

00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:20.707
- You can relax. You did great.
- I gotta say, thank you.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:24.711
I was really nervous. I'm told I come on
too strongly, too many jokes.

00:17:24.878 --> 00:17:27.964
And then it was really hard
to side step that "duty" thing.

00:17:30.133 --> 00:17:31.843
Duties?

00:17:33.094 --> 00:17:34.888
Doodies?

00:17:36.473 --> 00:17:37.807
Poo?

00:17:39.851 --> 00:17:41.561
Poo?

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:47.567
Oh, my God. This doesn't count. Okay?
The interview was over.

00:17:47.734 --> 00:17:51.529
That was the real Chandler Bing.
This is some crazy guy in the hall.

00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:55.241
Call security! There's a crazy guy
out in the hall!

00:17:56.409 --> 00:17:58.161
Poo?

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.997
I'll look forward to your call.

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.130
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:11.424
- You're back from your date.
- How are you?

00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:16.346
I'm fine. But that's not important.
What's important is how was she?

00:18:17.055 --> 00:18:19.724
Uh, it was fun. We just had coffee.

00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:24.521
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh, coffee,
a little rub-rub-rub under the table?

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:28.399
Heh, what's going on?
Do you not like Katie?

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:31.027
No. No, she was nice.

00:18:31.194 --> 00:18:33.905
I mean, she was a little slutty,
but who isn't?

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:36.074
Well, I liked her.

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:41.162
Of course you did. You'd date a gorilla
if it called you Indiana Jones.

00:18:42.247 --> 00:18:45.416
Did you get a fresh batch
of pregnancy hormones today?

00:18:46.334 --> 00:18:49.921
No. It's just that... Katie bothered me.

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.422
Why? What was wrong with her?

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:56.636
Ugh, there was nothing wrong with her.
All right? She was perfectly lovely.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:18:59.556
- Okay. So, what's the matter?
- I don't want you to date her.

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:04.435
Heh, what? Why? What, are you jealous?

00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:08.606
Yes. And not because
I want you to go out with me.

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:11.109
Because I don't want you
to go out with anybody.

00:19:12.443 --> 00:19:16.406
I know it's a terrible thing to even think this
and it's inappropriate...

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:21.161
...but I want you to be at my constant
beck and call, 24 hours a day.

00:19:21.995 --> 00:19:25.582
I'm very sorry, but that is
just the way that I feel.

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:31.504
- Okay.
- What?

00:19:31.671 --> 00:19:35.466
I won't date. I'll, uh...

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:38.761
I'll be here with you all the time.

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:41.973
Really?

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.727
But I'm being so unreasonable.

00:19:47.854 --> 00:19:52.734
True, but you're allowed to be
unreasonable. You're having our baby.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:57.363
Oh...

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:01.034
Oh, Ross, thank you. Thank you.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:06.873
You feel better?

00:20:07.165 --> 00:20:11.211
No, not really. You're pressing
the baby into my bladder...

00:20:11.377 --> 00:20:13.713
...and now I have to pee. Sorry.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:15.006
- Okay.
- Rash?

00:20:15.173 --> 00:20:18.635
- Yeah?
- Just one thing. Um...

00:20:19.385 --> 00:20:25.266
We live together. You're having our
baby. I'm not gonna see anybody else.

00:20:25.433 --> 00:20:28.895
Are you sure you don't want
something more?

00:20:32.023 --> 00:20:36.069
Wow. I don't know, maybe...

00:20:36.236 --> 00:20:38.738
Oh, Rach,
I was just messing around. Heh.

00:20:41.074 --> 00:20:45.328
- Like you did when I had to pee?
- Oh! Ha! I knew that.

00:20:45.495 --> 00:20:47.664
I knew that!
I was just messing with you too!

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:54.170
Okay. Because for a minute
you seemed...

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:57.298
- No, no, no, no. No! It's just... Ha!
- ...like you actually...

00:20:57.465 --> 00:20:59.133
That's just because
I'm such a good messer!

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.510
Ah! Ah, heh.

00:21:06.975 --> 00:21:08.059
- Rash?
- Yeah?

00:21:08.226 --> 00:21:09.352
- The bathroom?
- Right.

00:21:14.524 --> 00:21:17.652
I had a great time. I learned how to bake,
ate great food.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:22.323
The first A I've gotten since 7th grade
and I didn't have to sleep with the teacher.

00:21:23.741 --> 00:21:26.828
- Oh, look. Acting for Beginners.
- Yeah.

00:21:26.995 --> 00:21:28.663
Wanna feel good about yourself?

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:30.832
- What the hell!
- Okay.

00:21:30.999 --> 00:21:33.376
All right, let's start with some basics.

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:39.299
Can anybody tell me what the difference
between upstage and downstage is?

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:48.182
Yeah, this was a stupid idea.
