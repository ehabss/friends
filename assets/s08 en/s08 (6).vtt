WEBVTT

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.295
- Hey, guys, guess what.
- What?

00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:08.674
I know it's last minute, but we've
decided to have a Halloween party.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.009
- Oh, good!
- Great!

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:12.636
- And everybody has to wear costumes.
- Oh, I don't know...

00:00:14.556 --> 00:00:16.348
Come on, it'll be fun.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:21.562
Uh, I'll be there. I have to wear a
costume to my classes that day anyway.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.522
Tell me you're not gonna dress
like a dinosaur.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.441
Pfft, heh.

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:27.359
Not two years in a row.

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:32.781
- I'll come, but I'm not dressing up.
- You have to.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.746
No. Halloween is stupid. Dressing up,
pretending to be someone you're not.

00:00:38.913 --> 00:00:40.706
You're an actor.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:43.959
Ross, are you gonna bring Mona?

00:00:44.127 --> 00:00:47.046
- Yeah. Yeah, I will.
- The girl from their wedding?

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.464
- Yeah.
- Wow, hey.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:52.718
If she needs any ideas for costumes,
she could be a, uh, bikini model...

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:55.596
...or a slutty nurse,
or a sexy cheerleader.

00:00:55.764 --> 00:00:59.016
Or, ooh, ooh. Leatherface
from Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

00:00:59.184 --> 00:01:02.686
No, no, no! Slutty Leatherface.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:06.982
Wasn't Joey hitting on her
at the wedding too?

00:01:07.192 --> 00:01:10.194
That's right, he was hitting on her.

00:01:10.361 --> 00:01:15.115
And I got her. I guess
the better man won. Heh.

00:01:15.283 --> 00:01:18.077
Please don't take her from me.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.830
- Ursula!
- Oh. Heh.

00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:05.582
Wait. It's me, Phoebe.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.502
Oh, I thought there was a mirror there.
Okay. Bye.

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.629
Wait a second!

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:12.923
Um, so, what's new with you?

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:16.844
Um, nothing. I mean,
I'm getting married next week.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:18.762
- What?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.057
It's gonna be a small ceremony.
Just family.

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:23.517
His.

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:25.185
Huh.

00:02:25.353 --> 00:02:26.687
Okay.

00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:28.522
I'm really happy for you.

00:02:29.023 --> 00:02:33.735
Wait. If, um... If you want to come,
I guess that'd be okay.

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:35.529
- Really?
- Sure, why not?

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:37.990
You could be my "sister" for the day.

00:02:38.158 --> 00:02:40.868
Yeah, heh, okay.

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:43.745
Um, you know, my friends are having
a Halloween party tonight...

00:02:43.913 --> 00:02:46.415
...at my old apartment,
so you could come.

00:02:46.583 --> 00:02:48.834
Maybe I could meet the guy
you're marrying.

00:02:49.002 --> 00:02:52.087
Well, I'm supposed
to be working tonight.

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:55.340
I'm supposed to be working now,
so who cares!

00:02:56.009 --> 00:03:00.345
- By the way, it's a costume party.
- Oh, okay, so that's why you're...

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.764
No.

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.850
But thanks.

00:03:11.232 --> 00:03:13.358
- Hi.
- You're supposed to wear a costume.

00:03:13.526 --> 00:03:15.569
I am. I am a woman...

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:18.780
...who spent a lot of money on a dress
and she wants to wear it...

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:21.825
...because soon
she won't be able to fit into it.

00:03:21.993 --> 00:03:23.911
- Oh. I'm Catwoman.
- Ah.

00:03:24.078 --> 00:03:26.288
Who wants the dress
when you're too big for it.

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:27.789
Okay.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.335
- Trick or treat!
- Oh! Can I give out candy?

00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:33.045
I really want to be with kids.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.465
Ever since I got pregnant,
I have the strongest maternal instincts.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:39.635
- Trick or treat!
- Just a minute!

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.476
We... Aah! Look at you guys!

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:52.481
- Wow! You are a very scary witch.
- Thank you.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:56.360
- And you are a very funny clown.
- Thank you.

00:03:56.527 --> 00:03:57.903
And you...

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.280
...are so in style right now.

00:04:01.324 --> 00:04:03.408
You know, I work at Ralph Lauren.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:07.412
The whole fall line has got
this equestrian theme going on.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.208
- Did you see the cover of Vogue...?
- Could I just have the candy?

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.213
Yeah. Sure.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.807
Ah, Catwoman. So we meet again.

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.060
So we do, Supergirl.

00:04:30.812 --> 00:04:33.230
It's me, Phoebe.

00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:38.235
Monica, can I talk to you
for a second?

00:04:43.908 --> 00:04:46.076
Listen, I appreciate
you getting the costume.

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:47.494
Oh, you did this to him?

00:04:48.579 --> 00:04:50.539
What? I thought he'd love it.

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:52.791
His favorite book
was The Velveteen Rabbit.

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.419
The Velveteen Rabbit
was brown and white.

00:04:57.005 --> 00:04:59.339
It was either a pink bunny,
or no bunny at all.

00:04:59.507 --> 00:05:02.134
No bunny at all.
Always no bunny at all!

00:05:04.762 --> 00:05:07.097
- Hey.
- You didn't dress up either?

00:05:07.265 --> 00:05:09.975
Yes, I did. I'm Chandler.

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:16.648
Dude, what happened?

00:05:17.775 --> 00:05:20.569
- How is that me?
- Okay, ahem.

00:05:20.737 --> 00:05:21.737
I'm Chandler.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:26.658
- Ha, ha! That is so you!
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.911
- When have I ever done that?
- When have I ever done that?

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:37.044
- Trick or treat.
- Oh!

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:43.842
Oh, you're just the prettiest ballerina
ever I've ever seen.

00:05:44.344 --> 00:05:46.053
Thank you.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.014
Oh, wow. That deserves another candy.

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:51.433
- Thank you.
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:05:53.436 --> 00:05:57.105
I have to say,
that earns "two-two" pieces of candy.

00:05:57.273 --> 00:05:59.066
I love you!

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.651
Oh! Aw...

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:03.779
Oh, honey, here, take it all.

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:11.370
Monica? We need more candy.

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:14.414
- What? There's only been four kids.
- I know.

00:06:14.582 --> 00:06:18.168
But one said she loved me,
so I gave her everything.

00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:20.337
No wonder you're pregnant.

00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.883
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:31.098
- What are you supposed to be?
- Remember the Russian satellite, Sputnik?

00:06:33.017 --> 00:06:37.646
Well, I'm a potato. Or a "spud"...

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:40.899
...and these are my antenna.

00:06:41.067 --> 00:06:44.194
So Sputnik becomes?

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:51.827
Spud-nik! Spud-nik.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:56.081
Wow, I don't have
the worst costume anymore.

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:01.503
Hey, all right! Ross came as doodie.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:07.342
- No, I'm not doodie.
- No, space-doodie.

00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:17.853
- God!
- Hey, sweetie.

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:22.983
- Aren't you gonna give me a kiss?
- Okay, I will.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:25.485
But right after, you have to tell me
who you are.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.989
- Ursula?
- Ursula's fiancé?

00:07:29.157 --> 00:07:30.866
- Oh, my God. You're the sister.
- Yeah.

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:34.536
- I just slapped my future sister-in-law's ass.
- Yeah.

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:38.165
I'm an idiot. Is your mother here?
I could give her a slap on the butt.

00:07:38.332 --> 00:07:41.960
- My mother killed herself.
- See, and I knew that.

00:07:44.464 --> 00:07:46.047
Now I'm sweating.

00:07:46.215 --> 00:07:51.761
I'm really sweating. Now I'm saying look
at me, I'm even sweatier. I should go.

00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:53.805
No. We'll start over.

00:07:53.973 --> 00:07:56.766
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.
- Eric.

00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:59.728
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- The sweat's in my eyes.

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:01.563
- It's burning.
- Okay.

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:03.023
- Thank you.
- There.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:06.067
- So, what are you?
- I don't think they have a name for it.

00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:08.403
I get nervous, and I sweat like crazy.

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:15.494
- No, I meant your costume.
- Oh, um, I'm a solar system.

00:08:15.661 --> 00:08:17.913
My student's helped me.
I teach second grade.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.916
- I love the second grade.
- Really?

00:08:21.083 --> 00:08:24.127
It's better than first grade,
where you don't know what's going on.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.922
And definitely better than third grade.

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:30.759
You know, with all the politics
and the mind games.

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:35.764
- So, what do you do?
- I'm a masseuse, by day.

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.727
- You don't have to stand here with me.
- I'm having fun.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:46.149
- I'm really excited for you and Ursula.
- I feel very lucky. She's great.

00:08:46.484 --> 00:08:50.445
- She's the most beautiful woman ever.
- Thank you.

00:08:56.827 --> 00:08:58.828
- Hey, Joey?
- Yeah?

00:08:58.996 --> 00:09:02.374
- You read comic books, right?
- Exclusively.

00:09:03.084 --> 00:09:06.670
Who do you think would win in a fight,
Catwoman or Supergirl?

00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:09.089
- Catwoman, hands down.
- Yeah.

00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:12.592
Between you and Phoebe?
I'd give the edge to Phoebe.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.719
- What? Really?
- You kidding?

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:20.642
Phoebe lived on the street, okay?
Plus, she's got this crazy temper. She...

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.978
She's not right behind me, is she?

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.105
- No, you're fine.
- Okay.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:28.483
- Do you think I could take Rachel?
- I'm not sure.

00:09:28.651 --> 00:09:30.986
What? Come on, I am tough!

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:34.072
Punch me here, as hard as you can!

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.617
Relax. What are you taking this
so seriously for? It doesn't matter.

00:09:37.785 --> 00:09:42.831
Really? What would you say if I told you
Ross or Chandler could beat you up?

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:45.208
I would say, "Woman, please."

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.547
Hey, Ursula's fiancé is really sweet.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:53.258
He's a teacher,
he does volunteer work.

00:09:53.426 --> 00:09:59.222
Normally, I don't like sweaty guys.
But I could just mop him up.

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:02.684
- Oh, my God, Phoebe?
- What?

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:04.894
You're getting a crush
on your sister's fiancé.

00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:06.605
No, I'm not, you are!

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.150
Here comes the temper.

00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:15.488
- Trick or treat.
- Hi.

00:10:15.656 --> 00:10:19.826
Hi. Know what? We're out of candy.
But someone went to get some.

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:24.914
And I've been giving out money,
but I'm out of that too.

00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:27.459
- Can I write you a check?
- Okay.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:31.463
- Okay. What's your name?
- Lelani Mayolanofavich.

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:37.260
Okay, I'm just gonna write this out
to "cash."

00:10:39.513 --> 00:10:41.723
- Hi.
- Hi, Mona.

00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:43.892
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:47.562
Joey's gonna be thrilled. He was hoping
you'd come by as a slutty nurse.

00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:51.274
Um, actually, I'm just a nurse.

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:56.780
You'd think that would embarrass me,
but, you see, I'm maxed out.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.617
- Hey, you made it.
- Hi! Wait.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:05.163
- You're, um... You're a potato?
- Well, I'm a spud?

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.956
And the antenna...

00:11:07.124 --> 00:11:09.751
- Oh, my God, you're Spud-nik!
- Yes!

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:12.212
Marry her.

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:15.632
Okay, here's a good one for you.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.593
Who do you think would win a fight
between Ross and Chandler?

00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:21.262
I can't answer that.
Chandler's my husband.

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.932
- So Ross?
- Yeah.

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:27.435
- Hey, beautiful.
- Hello, handsome.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:28.937
Oh, God.

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:33.942
Aw, look at you two.
So when did you guys meet?

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.569
- Two weeks ago.
- Two weeks, that's it?

00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:40.573
I know. It sounds crazy, and it's not
like me to do something impulsive.

00:11:40.783 --> 00:11:43.660
But she's so perfect,
and we have so much in common.

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:44.911
Oh, really?

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:47.497
- We're both teachers.
- Huh?

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.377
- And we were both in the Peace Corps.
- Peace Corps, really?

00:11:55.172 --> 00:11:57.799
In fact, when we were
building houses in Uruguay...

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:01.386
...we were just two towns apart
and we never met.

00:12:01.595 --> 00:12:05.515
Yeah. It wasn't a town when I got
there, but it was a town when I left.

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:10.854
- Shall we get me really drunk?
- Sure.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.482
Ha, ha. Ugh.

00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:18.695
Howdy, doodie.

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:20.822
That's funny, yeah.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.869
You're the funniest man here in a
bunny costume his wife made him wear.

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:30.540
Relax, man. Relax.
You're looking a little flushed.

00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:38.339
Hey, I think we might find out
the answer to our question.

00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:41.634
- What question?
- Who could kick whose ass in a fight...

00:12:41.802 --> 00:12:42.886
...you or Ross?

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:47.056
- There's no question.
- So you think Ross too?

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:52.353
- You picked Ross?
- Ross is really strong.

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:56.691
He's the strongest out of all three
of you. Except for Joey.

00:12:57.985 --> 00:13:02.864
- I can not believe you didn't pick me.
- In her defense, she's right. I am stronger.

00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:05.116
I would destroy you.

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:09.996
Oh, really? You think you're stronger?
Why don't you prove it?

00:13:10.915 --> 00:13:13.666
Oh, I'll prove it.
I'll prove it like a theorem!

00:13:13.834 --> 00:13:17.128
All right! Okay, stop it. Stop it!

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:19.380
Stop! No one's gonna fight.

00:13:19.548 --> 00:13:23.218
People came to see a fight,
let's give them what they came for!

00:13:25.262 --> 00:13:29.682
- You guys could arm-wrestle.
- Yeah, listen to the slutty nurse.

00:13:30.434 --> 00:13:33.394
- You're going down.
- Oh, yeah? You're going further down.

00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:34.771
Downtown!

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:37.899
Seriously, guys,
the trash talk is embarrassing.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:49.911
Oh, Gunther, you brought candy.
Thank you so much for picking this up.

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:52.997
- You are so sweet.
- Really?

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:57.210
Someday, you are gonna make some man
the luckiest guy in the world.

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.089
- Got to go.
- Trick or treat.

00:14:01.549 --> 00:14:05.176
Hi! Wow! There you go.

00:14:05.928 --> 00:14:08.721
My friend Lewis told me
you were giving out money.

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.309
Oh, yeah, we were,
but, um, now we've got candy.

00:14:13.477 --> 00:14:16.604
I'd rather have the money.

00:14:17.731 --> 00:14:20.650
Well, that's not your choice.
Happy Halloween!

00:14:20.818 --> 00:14:22.193
This isn't fair.

00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:25.780
Is it fair that all you did was put on a cape
and I gotta give you stuff?

00:14:25.948 --> 00:14:27.949
Shut up!

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:29.742
You shut up!

00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:35.790
- You can't tell me to shut up.
- Uh, I think I just did.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:38.376
And uh-oh, here it comes again. Shut up!

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:41.546
- Uh, Rach.
- No, I got it. I'm good. I got it.

00:14:44.008 --> 00:14:46.134
Wait, I had one more thing to say.

00:14:46.302 --> 00:14:47.927
Oh, right. Shut up.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.722
You're a mean old woman.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.765
Oh, wait! No. Shut... Don't cry!

00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:55.059
Let me get my checkbook!

00:14:55.227 --> 00:14:57.395
Honey, you don't have to do this.

00:14:57.563 --> 00:15:00.440
It's the strength you have inside
that means the most to me.

00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:04.903
You're loyal, you're honest
and you have integrity.

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:08.156
That's the strength I want
in the man I love.

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:11.451
That means nothing to me. Come on!

00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.077
Ugh.

00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:15.204
- Hi, liar.
- Hey.

00:15:16.123 --> 00:15:18.499
You know, the only reason
he's marrying you...

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:21.878
...is because he thinks the things
you were saying were true.

00:15:22.046 --> 00:15:24.631
- They could be true.
- But they're not.

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:27.216
Yeah. It's a fine line, huh?

00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:31.012
- Why are you lying to him?
- I don't know.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:36.017
He said he did this stuff, I said I did it
too. He got so excited, it was fun.

00:15:36.185 --> 00:15:37.310
Honey?

00:15:37.478 --> 00:15:42.357
It's a disgusting habit,
and I want you to quit now!

00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:45.193
She's helped so many people
quit smoking.

00:15:46.028 --> 00:15:47.695
We'd better get going.

00:15:47.863 --> 00:15:50.823
- You have a church group meeting.
- Right.

00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:58.081
- Well, it was nice meeting you.
- You too.

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:02.961
And, Ursula, it was really nice
meeting you tonight!

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:06.130
Pheebs, come on! Bunny versus Doodie.
We're waiting!

00:16:09.176 --> 00:16:12.595
Okay, guys. One match,
winner take all.

00:16:13.806 --> 00:16:16.265
Wait. What does the winner get?

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:18.309
- Pride.
- And dignity.

00:16:18.477 --> 00:16:21.187
Heh. Okay, if you say so.

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.398
All right, ready, set, go!

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:26.734
Come on!

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.830
- Wow, they're both really strong.
- Or equally weak.

00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:42.834
Oh, God. Chandler's making
his sex face.

00:16:48.424 --> 00:16:53.720
- So you getting tired?
- No. I could do this all day.

00:16:53.887 --> 00:16:56.264
Yeah. Me too.

00:16:58.434 --> 00:17:01.561
- Getting a little tired, though.
- God, I'm exhausted.

00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:07.859
This is starting to look bad for me,
okay? Mona's standing right there.

00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:13.114
Oh, God, she's talking to Joey!
You've got to let me win!

00:17:13.282 --> 00:17:16.075
No way. Let me win.
My wife thinks I'm a wimp.

00:17:16.243 --> 00:17:17.827
Hey, at least you have a wife.

00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:21.622
I keep getting divorces
and knocking people up.

00:17:23.584 --> 00:17:26.294
And I'm dressed as doodie.

00:17:27.212 --> 00:17:32.300
- You're Spud-nik.
- Come on, who we kidding? I'm doodie.

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:36.095
- Please? She's watching.
- Ugh.

00:17:36.972 --> 00:17:39.474
- Fine.
- Thanks.

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:43.061
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yeah!

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:44.812
Yay!

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:46.731
My hero!

00:17:46.899 --> 00:17:48.232
You're a weird lady.

00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:55.448
- Hey, Ursula said she left her purse.
- Oh.

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:59.410
What a relief. It has the numbers
of the people in her prayer chain.

00:17:59.578 --> 00:18:01.204
I'm sure it does. Yeah. Yeah.

00:18:01.371 --> 00:18:03.748
Well, guess I'll see you at the wedding.

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:10.046
Um, listen. I don't think I'm gonna
make it to the wedding.

00:18:10.214 --> 00:18:14.008
- I wish you all the luck in the world.
- We'll be okay.

00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:18.513
It's so perfect,
and she's been saving herself for me.

00:18:20.349 --> 00:18:24.310
- I can't let you do this. She's lying to you.
- What?

00:18:24.478 --> 00:18:28.689
She is lying. And I bet
I could prove it. Excuse me.

00:18:28.857 --> 00:18:32.193
Okay. Yeah, not a prayer chain.

00:18:32.361 --> 00:18:36.322
But what looks like a detailed drawing
of a bank floor plan.

00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:42.995
Here's the name tag from the restaurant
where she works as a waitress.

00:18:43.163 --> 00:18:45.540
Not a teacher, a waitress.

00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:48.668
Here's her driver's license.
She always lies about this.

00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:51.963
- How old did she say she was?
- She told me she was 25.

00:18:52.548 --> 00:18:54.882
Aw. I almost don't want to show you this.

00:18:56.343 --> 00:18:59.428
Just remember, I'm a minute younger.

00:19:02.057 --> 00:19:03.641
I am so stupid.

00:19:04.601 --> 00:19:06.811
Of course she's lying.
She's not a teacher.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:12.483
There's no such thing as a "Top Secret
School for the Children of Spies."

00:19:14.611 --> 00:19:16.863
No, you're not stupid.

00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:18.823
I'm not smart.

00:19:23.453 --> 00:19:27.915
I just wanted so much
to be impulsive for once.

00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:30.293
- To be romantic.
- That's good.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.838
You should be impulsive
and you should be romantic.

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:36.215
Just, you did it with the wrong person.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:42.722
- What?
- It's weird, two people look so alike.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.515
And so different.

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:49.145
Eric! Let's go!

00:19:50.647 --> 00:19:54.192
- Better go deal with it.
- Yeah, you should.

00:20:00.073 --> 00:20:02.783
Hurry up! I gotta pray!

00:20:12.502 --> 00:20:14.086
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:17.381
Well, I had to give the kid
50 bucks to stop crying.

00:20:18.675 --> 00:20:21.719
- That's not so bad.
- I also had to go to a couple houses...

00:20:21.887 --> 00:20:23.763
...as his girlfriend.

00:20:24.514 --> 00:20:27.141
Ugh, I am just awful with children.

00:20:27.309 --> 00:20:31.729
Come on, you're good with kids.
They're just crazy on Halloween.

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:34.649
They're all greedy,
hopped up on sugar.

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:38.402
- Really? That's all it is?
- Absolutely.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:45.076
Halloween is the worst. Except
for Christmas. And their birthdays.

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:48.412
They get crazy during the summer too.

00:20:48.664 --> 00:20:52.124
And any time they're
hungry or sleepy.

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.585
Kids are tough.
Good luck with that. Pfft.

00:20:59.758 --> 00:21:02.510
Look, I wanted to tell you,
I'm sorry you lost.

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:06.472
Oh, listen. I got a secret for you.
I let him win.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:09.850
- Heh, heh.
- Was that a secret, or a lie?

00:21:10.018 --> 00:21:12.353
- No, I let him... Ross?
- Yeah?

00:21:12.521 --> 00:21:14.730
Would you tell her
I let you win, please?

00:21:14.898 --> 00:21:18.150
Oh, yeah, uh, Chandler let me win.

00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:24.156
No, Chandler's really strong.
Oh, my arm is so sore. Oh, nurse?

00:21:26.201 --> 00:21:29.120
I am strong. I'll show you.

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.913
Chandler, please.

00:21:31.081 --> 00:21:32.999
Oh, what's the matter? Are you scared?

00:21:34.001 --> 00:21:35.584
Let's go, big bunny!

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.338
One, two, three. Go!

00:21:45.387 --> 00:21:47.096
I'm gonna kill myself.
