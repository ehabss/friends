WEBVTT

00:00:08.508 --> 00:00:10.467
Joey?

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.054
Oh, my God.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:17.725
Okay.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.819
So, uh...

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.699
...I guess we should
make it official, huh?

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.453
Uh, look, Rach, I...

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:42.082
Hey, Ross is here!
Hey, look, it's my good friend Ross.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.169
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey, Joey.

00:00:46.296 --> 00:00:48.297
- Hey, you.
- Hey, you.

00:00:48.506 --> 00:00:52.634
And he brought flowers. Oh, thanks, Ross.
I'm really more of a candy kind of guy.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.056
You're weird today.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.811
Listen, I, uh, wanted to talk to you
about something.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.732
Yeah. Actually, uh, I kind of need
to talk to you too.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.735
- Uh, Joey, could you give us a minute?
- No.

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:15.699
- What?
- I'm sorry. I meant, "No."

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:18.744
- Hi. Hey, look who's here.
- Hey.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:22.164
Where's my granddaughter?
I've been practicing my magic tricks.

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:25.167
He pulled a quarter out of my ear.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:28.754
- Hey, where's, uh, Mom?
- She went to pick up Aunt Liddy.

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:31.632
Aunt Liddy's coming?
That means we get $5 each.

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:37.638
So when do I get to meet Emma
and show her this:

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.224
Okay, wow.

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:44.311
Uh, Dad, Emma's in the nursery.
I'll take you now if you want.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.023
- But I really want to talk to you.
- I know. I still need to talk to you.

00:01:48.233 --> 00:01:50.609
But before you guys do that,
I need to talk to you.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.695
And, Ross, I need to talk to you.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:56.240
- Oh, and I need to talk to you.
- About what?

00:01:56.449 --> 00:01:59.159
To see if you know
what these guys are talking about.

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:49.960
Isn't she beautiful?

00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.882
Look at her, my first grandchild.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.845
What about Ben?

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:04.641
Well, of course, Ben.
I meant my first granddaughter.

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:06.393
Wow.

00:03:09.814 --> 00:03:13.233
Have, um, you thought any more
about you and Rachel?

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:16.737
Yeah, actually I was gonna talk to her
when you guys came in the room.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:21.241
Yay, that's so exciting. Wow.
You could've done that with us there.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.411
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, sure. Okay.

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.581
You can touch yourself in front of us,
but you can't talk to Rachel.

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:31.585
What? When have I ever
touched myself in front of you guys?

00:03:31.753 --> 00:03:37.341
Oh, please. Just before,
when you were asleep in the lounge.

00:03:37.508 --> 00:03:40.594
That Armenian family was watching you
instead of the TV.

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:46.808
That reminds me. That Mr. Hazmegian
still has my Game Boy.

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.395
- Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.816
Dude, I just did something terrible.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.694
That was you? I thought it was Jack.

00:03:58.446 --> 00:04:02.699
No, no. That was Jack.
Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.537
- What? Why does she think that?
- Because it kind of looked like I did.

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:09.748
Again, what?

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:13.168
Okay, I was down on one knee
with the ring in my hand...

00:04:13.378 --> 00:04:15.879
As we all are at some point
during the day.

00:04:17.382 --> 00:04:19.675
It wasn't my ring.
It fell out of Ross' jacket...

00:04:19.842 --> 00:04:22.970
...and when I knelt down to pick it up,
Rachel thought I was proposing.

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:25.264
Ross had a ring?
And he was gonna propose?

00:04:25.473 --> 00:04:28.600
- I guess.
- And you did it first?

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:31.979
This is gonna kill him. You know
how much he loves to propose.

00:04:32.772 --> 00:04:34.815
I know. I know. It's awful.

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:36.108
Well, what did she say?

00:04:37.568 --> 00:04:39.278
She said yes.

00:04:40.488 --> 00:04:42.531
Does Ross know?

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.659
Oh, my God.
What the hell am I gonna tell him?

00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:48.370
- Maybe you don't have to tell him.
- Ooh, I like that. Yeah.

00:04:49.455 --> 00:04:52.165
If you clear things up with Rachel,
Ross never needs to find out.

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:55.252
But you have to do it now before
he hears about it and kicks your ass.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:57.587
All right, let's not get carried away.

00:05:00.049 --> 00:05:01.591
I want a baby.

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.095
Honey, we've been over this.
I need to be facing the other way.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:11.560
Come on. If we have sex again, it'll double
our chances of getting pregnant.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:15.647
- I think that closet's still available.
- I am so tired.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:23.196
- Yeah, okay, but no foreplay.
- Deal.

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.411
Dad, seriously.

00:05:30.705 --> 00:05:34.791
You know, you really should
see someone about that.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.835
Noted.

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:41.882
I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute.
Are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.635
Are you kidding me?
I could stay and look at her forever.

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:50.849
Actually, uh...

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:56.730
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:05:56.898 --> 00:06:01.193
- Are you all right?
- Um... Uh...

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:05.655
- I think I just got engaged.
- Oh, my God. He did it?

00:06:05.865 --> 00:06:07.991
What? Did you know
he was gonna ask me?

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:12.537
Are you kidding?
I'm, like, the one who talked him into it.

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:16.500
I like to think of myself
as the puppet master of the group.

00:06:17.835 --> 00:06:21.546
- And you really think this is a good idea?
- I just talked him into it.

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:24.466
Don't tell me I have to do you too?

00:06:24.634 --> 00:06:28.303
- The puppet master gets tired, people.
- Okay.

00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:31.181
I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:35.018
Why? You two are so meant
to be together. Everybody thinks so.

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:37.646
Really? Even Ross?

00:06:38.815 --> 00:06:41.066
Especially Ross.

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:48.323
Oh, uh, hey, Pheebs. Uh, you know what?
I'll, uh, come back later.

00:06:50.535 --> 00:06:53.203
Wow, kind of a full house here. Heh.

00:06:54.747 --> 00:06:57.874
I guess I'll just... I'll come back.

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:03.755
There he goes. Your fiancé.

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:07.217
I guess so.

00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:09.928
Although he does
play with himself in his sleep.

00:07:10.138 --> 00:07:11.972
I can't say I'm surprised.

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:20.147
- Dad, what are you doing?
- There are people in there having sex.

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:26.069
It can't be me. I'm standing right here.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:28.947
- Wanna peek?
- No.

00:07:29.115 --> 00:07:30.198
Come on.

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:34.286
You know what?
I don't like you without Mom.

00:07:34.495 --> 00:07:36.538
Come on.

00:07:37.206 --> 00:07:39.541
We're not peeking?

00:07:41.627 --> 00:07:43.962
Well, I'm peeking.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.965
Oh, my God.

00:07:48.009 --> 00:07:52.095
Hello, sir. You know Monica.

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:02.147
Wow.

00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:10.071
- Hey, uh, is it okay to come in?
- Of course.

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:14.201
Oh, Joey, this ring, I...
It's beautiful. I love it.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:18.747
Yeah. Uh, look, Rach,
there's something I gotta tell you.

00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:21.208
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:25.629
- Are you ready to try nursing again?
- Yeah. Hi, Emma.

00:08:25.796 --> 00:08:27.797
Why do you think
she won't take my breast?

00:08:27.965 --> 00:08:30.342
It's all right, honey.
It takes babies a while to get it.

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:33.178
- But don't worry, it'll happen.
- Okay.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:35.722
Yowza.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:40.810
Okay, sweetie, you can do it.
Just open up and put it in your mouth.

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:43.522
Dear Lord.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:49.486
- I'm sorry, honey, what were you saying?
- Uh, yeah, look, I think that...

00:08:49.654 --> 00:08:52.572
Oh, look. She's pulling away again.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:54.824
Do you think my nipples
are too big for her mouth?

00:08:59.705 --> 00:09:01.831
She looks scared.
Doesn't she look scared?

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:04.501
You know, I don't really know her.

00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:08.421
Why don't we try massaging
the breast to stimulate the flow?

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:11.466
- Okay.
- Are you kidding me?

00:09:13.135 --> 00:09:15.971
This is so frustrating.
Why doesn't she want my breast?

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:18.723
I don't know. Maybe she's crazy.

00:09:21.435 --> 00:09:24.104
- Oh, hey, wait up.
- Hi.

00:09:24.272 --> 00:09:26.022
Congratulations.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:29.401
I didn't want to say anything in front
of Joey. I didn't know if he knew yet.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.113
What? That we had a baby?
Now let's give him a little credit. Heh.

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:36.741
Although he did eat a piece
of plastic fruit earlier.

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:39.578
No, no, that you
and Rachel are engaged.

00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:43.456
- Heh. What?
- Oh, it's a secret?

00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:47.877
Oh, goody. Yes. Ooh, we haven't done
the secret thing in a long time.

00:09:48.421 --> 00:09:52.132
Phoebe, there is no secret, okay?
I didn't propose.

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:53.383
Are you lying?

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:56.469
Is this like that time you tried
to convince us you were a doctor?

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:04.102
I am a doctor.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:08.857
You know what? I'm just gonna go
and talk to Rachel myself.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.610
All right. Well, me too.

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:14.863
- Shh.
- Well, should we wake her up?

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:16.823
No. No. Come on, let her sleep.

00:10:16.991 --> 00:10:21.411
- She's so exhausted.
- And so engaged. Dum-dum-dum.

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.092
Oh, my God. She thinks we're engaged.

00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:40.055
Why? Why, why would
she think we're engaged?

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:43.308
Perhaps because you gave her
an engagement ring?

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.186
You know, Ross,
doctors are supposed to be smart.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:49.898
- I didn't give her that ring.
- You didn't?

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:52.359
- No.
- So whose ring is it?

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.819
It's mine.

00:10:55.863 --> 00:10:57.822
- Is it an engagement ring?
- Yes.

00:10:58.032 --> 00:10:59.824
- But you didn't give it to her?
- No.

00:11:00.034 --> 00:11:02.077
- But you were going to propose?
- No.

00:11:02.286 --> 00:11:04.496
Huh. I might be losing interest in this.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.918
Look. Look, my mom
gave me that ring...

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.128
...because she wanted me
to propose to Rachel.

00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:14.506
But all I wanted to do was see...

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:18.510
...if she maybe, kind of wanted
to start things up again.

00:11:18.719 --> 00:11:21.262
Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

00:11:22.306 --> 00:11:25.684
I didn't want to rush into anything.
It seemed like she didn't want to either.

00:11:25.851 --> 00:11:28.853
But I don't understand
how any of this happened.

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:32.982
What, did she find the ring in my jacket,
assume I was gonna propose...

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:36.528
...throw it on
and just start telling people?

00:11:36.737 --> 00:11:39.656
No, no. She said you
actually proposed to her.

00:11:39.865 --> 00:11:44.244
Well, I didn't. I didn't propose.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.372
Unless...

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.042
Did I?

00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:57.882
I haven't slept in 40 hours and...

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:05.598
It does sound
like something I would do.

00:12:16.193 --> 00:12:18.570
Look, we can't stay in here forever.

00:12:18.738 --> 00:12:22.073
Ugh. It's just, I still can't believe
that my dad saw us having sex.

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:26.536
He didn't make it to one
of my piano recitals, but this he sees.

00:12:26.954 --> 00:12:30.874
This is okay. We're all adults here.
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

00:12:31.041 --> 00:12:34.753
Now, let's put our underwear
in our pockets and walk out the door.

00:12:40.968 --> 00:12:42.761
Hi, Dad.

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:48.892
- I can still call you that, right?
- Of course. I'll always be your dad.

00:12:49.059 --> 00:12:54.063
I just want you to know that what you
witnessed in there, that wasn't for fun.

00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:59.402
- It wasn't fun?
- Why, why, why would you?

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.489
Look, I just don't want you to think...

00:13:02.656 --> 00:13:05.325
...that we're animals who do it
whenever we want.

00:13:05.534 --> 00:13:07.202
Well, I don't think that.

00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:11.206
Before today, I never thought
of you two having sex at all.

00:13:11.373 --> 00:13:14.000
It was a simpler time.

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.921
The truth is, Dad, we're trying.

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:20.590
- What?
- Yeah, we're trying to get pregnant.

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:22.967
Oh, my God, this is so exciting.

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:25.553
Well, get back in there.
I'll guard the door.

00:13:25.721 --> 00:13:28.598
Ha, ha. That's okay, Dad,
we can wait until later.

00:13:28.766 --> 00:13:30.975
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't think so.
Aren't you ovulating?

00:13:31.477 --> 00:13:33.353
Daddy.

00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:35.146
You gotta get at it, princess.

00:13:35.314 --> 00:13:37.440
When your mother and I
were trying to conceive you...

00:13:37.608 --> 00:13:40.193
...whenever she was ovulating,
bam, we did it.

00:13:40.361 --> 00:13:41.903
That's how I got my bad hip.

00:13:42.988 --> 00:13:47.116
That's funny. This conversation's how
I got the bullet hole in my head.

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:50.912
This one time I had my knee
up on the sink, and your mother, she was...

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:55.166
Daddy, I don't think we need to hear about
the specific positions you and Mom had.

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:58.002
You're right.
This is about your positions.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.798
Now, what I saw in the closet
is not the optimum position...

00:14:01.966 --> 00:14:04.092
...for conceiving a child.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.012
- Although it might feel good.
- I don't feel good right now.

00:14:08.222 --> 00:14:12.100
But pleasure is important,
and it helps if the woman has an orgasm.

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:15.603
You up to the task, sailor?

00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:18.898
Seriously, sir, my brains,
all over the wall. Heh.

00:14:25.197 --> 00:14:27.991
- Hey.
- Hey. Oh, I need to tell you something.

00:14:28.450 --> 00:14:32.704
Well, now's a good time.
I'm on my way to have my ears cut off.

00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:35.164
Joey asked me to marry him.

00:14:35.499 --> 00:14:37.375
- What?
- Joey proposed to me.

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:41.963
- Is he crazy? You just had Ross' baby.
- Well, I said yes.

00:14:42.172 --> 00:14:44.924
What, are you crazy?
You just had Ross' baby.

00:14:46.468 --> 00:14:50.263
It's so inappropriate.
No, it is worse than that. It is wrong.

00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:53.182
It is bigger than mine.

00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:57.729
I know. Days of our Lives,
thank you very much.

00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.273
- You can't marry him.
- Why not?

00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:03.943
Come on, I don't want to do this alone,
and he's such a sweet guy.

00:15:04.111 --> 00:15:05.612
And he loves me so much.

00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:07.071
Well, do you love him?

00:15:08.574 --> 00:15:09.657
Sure.

00:15:11.452 --> 00:15:15.538
- Sure?
- Yeah, I mean, whatever.

00:15:15.748 --> 00:15:18.499
Honey, the question is...

00:15:18.667 --> 00:15:20.376
...do you really want to marry Joey?

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:24.005
No.

00:15:24.173 --> 00:15:27.008
No, I don't.

00:15:29.261 --> 00:15:32.055
Could you be a dear and go tell him?

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:35.808
You still haven't told Rachel
you weren't proposing?

00:15:35.976 --> 00:15:38.353
No. She had the ring on...

00:15:38.562 --> 00:15:41.606
...she seemed so excited,
and then she took her breast out.

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:45.735
Joey, you have to tell her what's going on.
And what did it look like?

00:15:47.154 --> 00:15:49.238
I didn't look at it.

00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:52.116
The stupid baby's head
was blocking most of it.

00:15:53.118 --> 00:15:55.828
Go and tell Rachel right now,
before Ross finds out.

00:15:55.996 --> 00:15:59.457
Look, it's not that easy.
She said she wanted to marry me.

00:15:59.625 --> 00:16:01.459
I don't want to hurt her.

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.963
Okay, look, just do it gently.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:07.340
You're right.

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:11.511
You're right. I'll go tell her now
before Ross finds out, and I'll be gentle.

00:16:11.679 --> 00:16:12.887
- I can do that.
- Okay.

00:16:13.055 --> 00:16:15.932
I am a gentle person.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.686
Oh, by the way, two people screwing
in there if you want to check that out.

00:16:28.779 --> 00:16:32.281
Hey.

00:16:33.158 --> 00:16:35.910
Listen, I, um...

00:16:36.537 --> 00:16:38.621
I heard about the engagement.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.374
Surprised?

00:16:42.584 --> 00:16:44.836
And confused.

00:16:48.298 --> 00:16:51.384
Rach, sweetie, I, um...

00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:54.345
I didn't propose to you.

00:16:55.764 --> 00:16:57.557
I know.

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.728
I don't think you do.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.066
You didn't propose to me.

00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:08.317
Joey did.

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:12.196
Poor baby, you're so tired.

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:19.787
Rach, I didn't propose to you.

00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:22.915
Joey didn't propose to you.

00:17:23.083 --> 00:17:27.128
And Chandler didn't propose to you.

00:17:28.005 --> 00:17:29.672
Uh...

00:17:30.132 --> 00:17:32.508
You didn't propose to me.

00:17:32.676 --> 00:17:35.762
Chandler didn't propose to me.

00:17:35.929 --> 00:17:37.722
But Joey did.

00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:40.892
Joey proposed to you?

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.395
- I can come back.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:48.107
- Joey, did you propose to her?
- No.

00:17:48.525 --> 00:17:52.737
- Yes, you did.
- Actually, technically, I didn't.

00:17:52.946 --> 00:17:56.407
- Well, then, why did you give me a ring?
- Wait.

00:17:56.575 --> 00:18:02.997
- You gave her the ring?
- No, and I did not ask her to marry me.

00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:05.958
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

00:18:06.126 --> 00:18:08.795
- You did, and don't you say you didn't.
- Ah.

00:18:08.962 --> 00:18:11.714
He was right there. He got down
on one knee and he proposed.

00:18:11.882 --> 00:18:14.717
- Whoa, you were down on one knee?
- Yeah, that looks bad.

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:19.430
But I didn't... I didn't propose.

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.350
- Then what did happen?
- Yeah, what did happen?

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:25.645
Okay, the ring fell on the floor,
and I went down to pick it up...

00:18:25.813 --> 00:18:29.190
...and you thought I was proposing.

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:33.486
Yeah, but you said,
"Will you marry me?"

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:35.571
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

00:18:35.781 --> 00:18:39.117
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did. Oh, my God, you didn't.

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:47.959
- Ugh! Why didn't you tell me that before?
- Well, I tried...

00:18:48.127 --> 00:18:50.795
...but people kept coming in,
and then you took your breast out.

00:18:51.004 --> 00:18:52.547
Whoa, hey.

00:18:54.383 --> 00:18:57.635
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You saw her breast?

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:01.305
I'll tell you about it later. Be cool.

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.060
Joey, then what the hell were you doing
with an engagement ring?

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:08.855
It wasn't my ring. It's Ross' ring.

00:19:09.064 --> 00:19:13.693
That's why I felt so bad, Rach,
because he was gonna propose.

00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:15.278
What?

00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:20.283
- You were gonna propose to me?
- Uh...

00:19:23.912 --> 00:19:25.329
No.

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:37.300
Well, this is awkward.

00:19:39.428 --> 00:19:45.266
But I was going to see if, you know,
maybe you wanted to start dating again.

00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:50.813
- But that... I mean, that was all, Rach.
- Dude, step up. I proposed.

00:19:51.481 --> 00:19:53.274
No, you didn't.

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:58.237
That's right. There's a lot going on here,
and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.

00:20:00.741 --> 00:20:03.451
Hey, she just woke up. She's hungry.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:06.412
- Why don't we give this another try?
- Okay.

00:20:06.622 --> 00:20:09.081
I can't believe you told her
I was gonna propose.

00:20:09.249 --> 00:20:13.044
- I can't believe you're not gonna propose.
- Hey, I am not gonna rush into anything.

00:20:13.253 --> 00:20:15.296
Oh, yeah, dude, I totally understand.

00:20:15.464 --> 00:20:18.925
Usually after I have a baby with a woman,
I like to slow things down.

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:21.719
- Oh, my God.
- What?

00:20:21.929 --> 00:20:23.638
She's doing it.
She's breast-feeding. Look.

00:20:23.889 --> 00:20:27.183
Uh-huh. Oh, it's beautiful.

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:28.684
I'll come back for her later.

00:20:28.852 --> 00:20:29.894
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:20:30.562 --> 00:20:35.983
- Oh, wow, this feels weird.
- What, good weird?

00:20:36.693 --> 00:20:38.736
Wonderful weird.

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.907
You know what, you guys?
I'm, uh... I'm gonna go too.

00:20:43.075 --> 00:20:47.328
And, uh, I'm sorry about everything.

00:20:47.537 --> 00:20:51.374
- Honey, don't worry, it was my mistake.
- No, Rach, I should've told you sooner.

00:20:51.541 --> 00:20:53.251
It's just that...

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:55.294
Man, that kid is going to town.

00:21:09.017 --> 00:21:12.436
Oh. She's perfect.

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:14.855
We're so lucky.

00:21:15.065 --> 00:21:17.191
We really are.

00:21:21.488 --> 00:21:26.701
Look, I know it's not a proposal,
and I don't know where you are...

00:21:26.868 --> 00:21:30.788
...but with everything that's been
going on and with Emma, I'm...

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:34.875
- I've been feeling...
- I know, I know.

00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:36.919
I've been feeling...

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:38.921
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:21:40.924 --> 00:21:43.884
Okay, well, that... Wow, okay, well, um...

00:21:44.052 --> 00:21:47.722
Then maybe at least we can
talk about us again?

00:21:49.516 --> 00:21:52.059
Yeah. Maybe.

00:21:52.227 --> 00:21:54.395
Well, good. Okay. Uh, heh...

00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:58.357
I kind of think, you know, if we... if...

00:22:01.153 --> 00:22:03.863
You're wearing the ring.

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.162
What...? What's that?

00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:17.209
And you told Phoebe
you were engaged.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.630
I'm sorry, what?

00:22:24.092 --> 00:22:27.762
When you thought Joey proposed...

00:22:29.139 --> 00:22:30.806
...did you say yes?

00:22:43.445 --> 00:22:48.783
Kids, I spoke to a doctor and picked up
these pamphlets on how to get pregnant.

00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:52.495
- Hey, Dad.
- Hi.

00:22:57.918 --> 00:23:02.505
Sorry to bother you again,
but could you pass my pamphlets back?

00:23:05.550 --> 00:23:07.343
Thank you.
