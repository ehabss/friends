WEBVTT

00:00:04.212 --> 00:00:06.797
He sprang to his sleigh
To his team gave a whistle

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:09.967
And away they all flew
Like the down of a thistle

00:00:10.135 --> 00:00:13.262
But I heard him exclaim
Ere he drove out of sight

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.892
"Merry Christmas to all
And to all a good night."

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.815
- Wow. That was great.
- Mm-hm.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.066
You really wrote that?

00:00:27.444 --> 00:00:28.944
Uh-huh.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.989
- Say goodbye, elves. I'm off to Tulsa.
- Aw.

00:00:32.157 --> 00:00:34.491
I can't believe you're not gonna be here
for Christmas.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.493
You're really not coming back?

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.830
Yeah, we have this paperwork that
needs to be filed by the end of the year.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.708
- If I don't get it done, I'll be fired.
- It's so unfair.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:45.919
- You don't even like your job.
- So? Who does?

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.588
- I like my job.
- I love my job.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:50.841
- I can't wait to go back to work.
- I can't get enough dinosaurs.

00:00:55.263 --> 00:00:57.347
I'm sorry I won't be here.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.309
It's just hard enough not seeing you
during the week...

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.436
...but for Christmas...

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:04.772
If this is what you have to do,
I understand.

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:07.316
Thanks.

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:08.734
I'll see you New Year's Day.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.070
You're not gonna be here
New Year's Eve?

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.324
- Did I not mention that?
- No.

00:01:15.617 --> 00:01:17.701
And to all a good night.

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:15.467
All right, everybody.
I know that it is Christmas Eve...

00:02:15.635 --> 00:02:19.012
...and you'd rather be with your families,
but there is no call for writing:

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.809
"Screw you, Mr. Bing"
on the back of my chair.

00:02:24.185 --> 00:02:26.353
By the way,
you can all call me Chandler.

00:02:27.647 --> 00:02:29.815
- Hey.
- Hey. Where you been?

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:33.318
I was, uh, checking out that insurance
company's Christmas party on three.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:36.738
It was really beautiful. They have
all these decorations and this huge tree.

00:02:36.906 --> 00:02:39.908
And I just thought,
to hell with them, we have to work.

00:02:40.076 --> 00:02:42.661
So I stole their ham.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.123
You hear that?
You may not be with your families...

00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.917
...but at least it's gonna smell like ham
in here.

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:52.254
My kid's in a play right now.

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:55.465
You know what?
I know what will cheer you guys up.

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.759
I had a talk with the boys in New York.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:00.095
I told them about all the hard work
you've been doing...

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:03.098
...and that a little Christmas bonus
may be in order.

00:03:03.308 --> 00:03:08.729
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.691
Well, that's like money in your pocket.

00:03:14.444 --> 00:03:16.695
All right, look, you want me to say it?
This sucks.

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:19.281
Being here sucks. This work sucks.

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.783
Now it feels like Christmas.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.119
I'm sorry.

00:03:24.287 --> 00:03:27.247
Hey, at least you get to go home
and be with your families tonight.

00:03:27.415 --> 00:03:29.958
I have to back to an empty hotel room
and lay down...

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:33.253
...on a very questionable bedspread.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:37.049
Then tomorrow morning, you get to have
Christmas morning in your own houses.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:39.635
Which, by the way,
none of you have invited me to.

00:03:39.844 --> 00:03:44.097
- You can come to my house.
- Ha, ha. No, thanks.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:47.684
- It was a nice pep talk.
- Oh, thanks.

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:51.313
I'm actually thinking about becoming
a motivational speaker.

00:03:52.273 --> 00:03:56.151
So if you were home right now,
what would you be doing?

00:03:56.361 --> 00:04:00.656
Typical Christmassy stuff, you know.
Our holidays are pretty traditional.

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:03.742
So here's a very special
holiday song...

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.537
...that I wrote for some
very important people to me.

00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:14.670
Went to the store, sat on Santa's lap

00:04:14.837 --> 00:04:17.881
Asked him to bring my friends
All kinds of crap

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:22.844
Said all you need
Is to write them a song

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:27.474
They haven't heard it yet
So don't try to sing along

00:04:27.642 --> 00:04:30.143
No don't sing along

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:36.775
Monica, Monica
Have a happy Hanukkah

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:44.658
Saw Santa Claus
He said hello to Ross

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:51.999
And please tell Joey
Christmas will be snowy

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.837
And Rachel and Chandler

00:05:02.093 --> 00:05:04.303
Happy holidays, everybody.

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:07.764
Okay, Pheebs, look in the kitchen.
I'll look in the back closet.

00:05:07.932 --> 00:05:11.393
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:14.104
Yeah.
Chandler, why don't you take a walk?

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.231
This doesn't concern you.

00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:19.651
We are looking for
our Christmas presents from Monica.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.196
- What? That's terrible.
- No, no. We do it every year.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.866
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.

00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:31.496
No. Yeah, we never find them.
She's always bested us, that wily...

00:05:31.664 --> 00:05:32.998
...minx.

00:05:33.875 --> 00:05:35.876
Don't worry.
We're gonna search here for an hour...

00:05:36.044 --> 00:05:38.170
...and then we're gonna go to Joey's
and search. Okay?

00:05:38.338 --> 00:05:41.131
No, not okay.
You can't look for Monica's presents.

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:43.175
- No, we have to.
- No, you don't have to.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:47.304
And you can't, because I live here too.

00:05:47.555 --> 00:05:51.975
- Well, then you should look with us.
- Why?

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:55.145
Chandler, aren't you worried about
what to get Monica for Christmas?

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.564
No, I have a great idea
for a present for her.

00:05:57.774 --> 00:06:00.817
Oh, pfft. That's it? A great idea again?

00:06:01.652 --> 00:06:04.404
Chandler, that's not enough.
What if she gets you a great present...

00:06:04.572 --> 00:06:06.740
...two medium presents
and a bunch of little presents...

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:10.160
...and you got her one great present?
That's just gonna make her feel bad.

00:06:10.328 --> 00:06:13.121
Why would you do that to her, Chandler?
Why? Why?

00:06:14.832 --> 00:06:17.250
- If I helped, we could find them faster.
- That's right.

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:22.506
- Ooh, ooh, we have a live one.
- It's a Macy's bag.

00:06:22.673 --> 00:06:23.965
Yeah.

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:27.928
- Oh.
- Ooh. Who's it for?

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:33.266
"Dear Losers: Do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:37.312
P.S. Chandler, I knew they'd break you."

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.442
Rach, these are for you.

00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:47.364
Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:51.701
No, but with this new car smell,
you'll think you do.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.499
Okay, Pheebs, your turn.

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:02.462
Ah. Toilet seat covers.

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:08.218
Is that what you were doing
while I was getting gas?

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:10.887
You guys.

00:07:11.055 --> 00:07:15.434
And for Ross, Mr. Sweet Tooth.

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.150
- You got me a cola drink?
- And... a lemon-lime.

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:27.028
Wow. Well, this... This is too much.

00:07:27.196 --> 00:07:30.073
I feel like I should get you
another sweater.

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:35.036
And last, but not least...

00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.583
They're ribbed, for your pleasure.

00:07:40.918 --> 00:07:42.878
Well, hey, Ben.

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:49.259
What if the Holiday Armadillo
told you all about the Festival of Lights?

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.969
Cool.

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:52.888
Come on, Ben.

00:07:55.558 --> 00:08:02.105
Years and years ago, there were
these people called the Maccabees.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:06.109
Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas.

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:10.197
- Santa.
- Hey.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:14.034
What are you doing here, Santa?

00:08:15.912 --> 00:08:18.788
Well, I'm here to see my old buddy Ben.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:21.208
What are you doing here...

00:08:21.375 --> 00:08:25.170
...weird turtle-man?

00:08:26.797 --> 00:08:33.470
I'm the Holiday Armadillo,
your part-Jewish friend.

00:08:34.805 --> 00:08:38.558
You sent me here to give Ben
some presents.

00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:41.019
Remember?

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:44.356
What?

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:46.733
Okay, Ben, why don't you open
some more presents?

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:49.653
Santa, the armadillo and I
will have a talk in the kitchen.

00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:53.657
There's a sentence I never thought
I'd say.

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.159
What are you doing?

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:59.496
You called everyone and said
you had trouble finding a Santa costume...

00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:02.290
...so I borrowed one
from a guy at work.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:05.001
Thank you, but you gotta leave.

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:06.670
- Why?
- Because...

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:09.589
...I'm finally getting him excited
about Hanukkah.

00:09:09.757 --> 00:09:11.258
And you're wrecking it.

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:15.512
But I didn't get to shake my belly
like a bowl full of jelly.

00:09:18.641 --> 00:09:22.477
I'm sorry, Chandler,
but this is really important to me.

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:26.856
Okay, fine. I'll give the suit back.

00:09:27.024 --> 00:09:31.361
Hey, you think you can keep it
another night?

00:09:33.114 --> 00:09:35.156
Santa? Really?

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:40.996
- Yeah, is that okay?
- Did your dad ever dress up like Santa?

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:46.126
- No.
- Then it's okay.

00:09:48.296 --> 00:09:50.505
You know what, everybody?

00:09:50.673 --> 00:09:52.882
Go home.
You should be with your families.

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.302
It's bad enough that we're working
New Year's Eve.

00:09:57.805 --> 00:10:01.182
Did I not tell anyone
about New Year's Eve?

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.395
All right, look, go. Go home, okay?
Merry Christmas. Go.

00:10:05.563 --> 00:10:07.981
- Merry Christmas.
- Peace on earth.

00:10:08.149 --> 00:10:12.861
- Bye.
- Good. Godspeed, good people.

00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:17.741
- You're not gonna go?
- Nah. I couldn't leave you alone.

00:10:17.908 --> 00:10:20.201
Oh. Thanks.

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.414
Besides, I can't leave until that
Christmas party downstairs clears out.

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:27.876
There are some pissed-off insurance people
looking for that ham.

00:10:28.085 --> 00:10:29.252
Ah.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.090
- Chandler Bing.
- Hi, honey. We're all here.

00:10:34.258 --> 00:10:36.051
We just want to wish you
a Merry Christmas.

00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.761
Merry Christmas.

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:43.266
Aw, merry Christmas. I miss you guys.

00:10:43.476 --> 00:10:46.061
So is it horrible?
Is everybody working really hard?

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:49.105
Uh, well, no, it's just, uh, me and Wendy.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:52.025
Wendy? That sounds like a girl's name.

00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:55.403
It is. Did I not tell you about her?

00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:59.366
Mm-hm. About the time you told me
about New Year's Eve.

00:10:59.575 --> 00:11:02.661
- Where's everybody else?
- I sent them home.

00:11:02.828 --> 00:11:06.623
Oh, you are such a good boss.
Is she pretty?

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:11.544
- Uh... Uh...
- Answer faster. Answer faster.

00:11:11.754 --> 00:11:14.589
- I don't know.
- Answer better. Answer better.

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.718
I don't think of her that way.
I mean, she's a, uh, colleague.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:21.971
- What does she do there?
- Oh, she's regional vice president.

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:24.641
- She's just below me.
- She did what?

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:32.065
Below me.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:35.819
Oh, wait, is Wendy the runner-up
Miss Oklahoma?

00:11:35.986 --> 00:11:37.654
What?

00:11:38.989 --> 00:11:41.157
Well, she didn't win.

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:44.327
All right, well, maybe I should let you...

00:11:44.537 --> 00:11:47.497
...and the second-prettiest girl
in Oklahoma get back to work.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:49.040
Well, second prettiest that year.

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.710
Of all the girls in Oklahoma,
she's probably...

00:11:51.919 --> 00:11:53.378
Chandler, stop talking.

00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:58.091
Honey, there's really
nothing to worry about.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.552
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

00:12:00.761 --> 00:12:02.011
Okay.

00:12:02.304 --> 00:12:05.014
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

00:12:05.182 --> 00:12:07.892
- Merry Christmas, you guys.
- Merry Christmas.

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:18.069
- The wife says hi.
- Ah. Fun conversation?

00:12:18.279 --> 00:12:21.322
Ah, well, she's just got
this weird idea that, uh...

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.867
...just because you and I are alone
something's gonna happen.

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.745
Huh? Really?

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:30.540
Hmm. Would that be so terrible?

00:12:32.501 --> 00:12:35.587
This is probably the wrong thing
to be worrying about...

00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:39.591
...but you're getting ham
on my only tie.

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:49.809
- Whoa, back off, missy.
- Ha, ha. Missy?

00:12:50.019 --> 00:12:52.645
I don't know. I'm not used to girls
making passes at me.

00:12:52.813 --> 00:12:56.858
Wait a minute.
Am I sexy in Oklahoma?

00:12:57.818 --> 00:13:02.405
- You are to me.
- No. No. No.

00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:06.993
- Look, I'm married.
- So? I'm married.

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.078
I'm happily married.

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.873
Oh. What's that like?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.212
- Right. So I'm sorry, but...
- Seriously? Happily married?

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:20.507
So that phone call before,
that was happy?

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:23.927
Well, look, it's not easy
to spend this much time apart.

00:13:24.136 --> 00:13:26.346
She's entitled to be a little paranoid.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:29.182
Or, in this case, right on the money.

00:13:30.309 --> 00:13:34.771
You know, she's amazing
and beautiful and smart.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:38.566
And if she were here right now,
she'd kick your ass.

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:46.574
Look, you're a really nice person,
ham stealing and adultery aside.

00:13:48.452 --> 00:13:51.246
But what I have with my wife
is pretty great.

00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:54.457
So nothing's ever gonna happen
between us.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.252
Okay, let me ask you something.

00:13:57.419 --> 00:14:01.005
If what you and your wife have
is so great...

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:04.425
...then why are you spending
Christmas with me?

00:14:05.845 --> 00:14:08.429
You were the most beautiful woman
in the room tonight.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.015
- Really?
- Are you kidding?

00:14:11.183 --> 00:14:14.185
You're the most beautiful woman
in most rooms.

00:14:21.986 --> 00:14:24.612
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?
You and I just made out.

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.240
- You and I are making out?
- Well, not anymore.

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:31.828
- But we don't do that.
- I know. I just thought it would be fun.

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:35.999
- How drunk are you?
- Drunk enough that I know I wanna do this.

00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:39.419
Not so drunk that you should feel guilty
about taking advantage.

00:14:41.171 --> 00:14:43.214
That's a perfect amount.

00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.347
- You know what's weird?
- What?

00:14:51.557 --> 00:14:53.933
- This doesn't feel weird.
- I know.

00:14:54.101 --> 00:14:59.314
- You're a really good kisser.
- Well, I have kissed over four women.

00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:02.400
- You wanna get under the covers?
- Uh-huh.

00:15:02.568 --> 00:15:04.110
Okay.

00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:14.662
Wow, you are really fast.

00:15:14.872 --> 00:15:18.041
It bodes well for me
that speed impresses you.

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:22.503
- We're gonna see each other naked.
- Yep.

00:15:22.671 --> 00:15:25.340
- You want to do it at the same time?
- Count of three?

00:15:25.507 --> 00:15:27.008
- One.
- Two.

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.260
Three.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:37.185
Well, I think it's safe to say
that our friendship is effectively ruined.

00:15:37.394 --> 00:15:40.021
Eh, we weren't that close anyway.

00:15:41.982 --> 00:15:44.400
So are you really gonna go out
with that nurse-man?

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.820
Well, uh, you and I
are just goofing around.

00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:51.616
I thought, why not
just goof around with him?

00:15:53.702 --> 00:15:57.956
I don't know if you've ever looked up
the term "goofing around" in the dictionary.

00:15:58.123 --> 00:16:00.416
Well, I have.

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:05.588
And the technical definition
is two friends...

00:16:05.756 --> 00:16:12.053
...who care a lot about each other
and have amazing sex...

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:18.810
...and just want to spend
more time together.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:22.146
But if you have this newfangled dictionary
that gets you mad at me...

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:26.025
...then we have to, you know,
get you my original dictionary.

00:16:28.821 --> 00:16:30.571
I am so bad at this.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.783
I think you're better
than you think you are.

00:16:33.993 --> 00:16:37.787
- Really? Okay. So if...?
- Know when to stop.

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:40.039
You know, I sensed that I should stop.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:43.292
- So we're okay?
- Yeah.

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:49.465
- Don't do the dance.
- Right.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:53.428
I can't get married without
something old, something new...

00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:56.389
...something borrowed, something blue.
- Okay, okay.

00:16:56.598 --> 00:16:58.891
Here's something blue and new.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:01.602
You are so efficient. I love you.

00:17:01.937 --> 00:17:03.146
- Let's go.
- No, no, wait.

00:17:03.313 --> 00:17:05.023
We need something old.

00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:09.444
Okay. I have a condom in my wallet
that I've had since I was 12.

00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:12.488
That'll work.

00:17:12.656 --> 00:17:14.490
I don't think so.

00:17:15.242 --> 00:17:17.160
Okay. Now we just need
something borrowed.

00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:22.623
- Here, just take this.
- That's stealing.

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.376
We'll bring it back.
Just put it under your dress.

00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:34.677
Aw.

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.015
Okay, one thing at a time.

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:43.144
Listen, um...

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:46.731
...I've been thinking.

00:17:47.357 --> 00:17:51.152
It's not fair for me to ask you to spend
all of your money on our wedding.

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.405
I mean, you work...
You work really hard for that.

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:56.824
- Well...
- Well, you work for that.

00:17:58.744 --> 00:18:01.454
Look, I've thought about it too.
And...

00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:06.250
...I'm sorry. I think we should spend
all of the money on the wedding.

00:18:07.169 --> 00:18:11.172
- You do?
- Yeah. I'm putting my foot down.

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:15.009
Yeah, look, when I proposed...

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:19.305
...I told you that I would do anything
to make you happy.

00:18:19.473 --> 00:18:23.142
And if having the perfect wedding
makes you happy, then...

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.269
Then that's what we're gonna do.

00:18:25.854 --> 00:18:28.314
You are so sweet.

00:18:30.734 --> 00:18:35.113
But wait. What about our...?
What about the future and stuff?

00:18:35.322 --> 00:18:39.075
Ah, forget about the future and stuff.
So we only have two kids.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:43.412
You know, we'll pick our favorite,
and that one will get to go to college.

00:18:44.623 --> 00:18:46.874
- You've thought about that?
- Yeah.

00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:51.087
- How many kids were we gonna have?
- Uh, four. A boy, twin girls...

00:18:51.255 --> 00:18:52.713
...and another boy.

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:57.260
- What else did you think about?
- Well, heh...

00:18:57.427 --> 00:19:01.097
...stuff like where we'd live, you know.

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:05.768
Like a small place outside the city where
our kids could ride their bikes and stuff.

00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:09.605
You know, we could have a cat
that had a bell on its collar...

00:19:09.773 --> 00:19:13.651
...and we could hear it every time
it ran through the little kitty door.

00:19:13.819 --> 00:19:18.114
Of course we'd have an apartment
over the garage where Joey could grow old.

00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:25.246
You know what?

00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:28.708
I don't...
I don't want a big, fancy wedding.

00:19:29.209 --> 00:19:31.377
- Sure you do.
- No.

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.381
I want everything that you've just said.

00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:38.009
I want a marriage.

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.761
- You sure?
- Mm-hm.

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:46.726
- I love you so much.
- I love you.

00:19:59.156 --> 00:20:05.119
- Ah! Oh, I love it.
- Really? You're not gonna return it?

00:20:05.329 --> 00:20:06.787
Well, not this second.

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:12.043
Hey, look, you guys. It's snowing.

00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:14.003
Oh.

00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:20.468
- Oh, wow, it's so beautiful.
- Wow, it really is.

00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.220
Ah.

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:26.098
Wendy's a fat-girl name.

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:28.768
Aren't we done with that?

00:20:28.936 --> 00:20:33.022
Okay, fine. Fine. Let's talk about snow.

00:20:34.107 --> 00:20:35.566
Do you think it's snowing in Tulsa...

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.569
...where my husband's having sex
on a copying machine?

00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:43.532
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.660
- Hey.
- Aw.

00:20:45.827 --> 00:20:49.372
Hey. Look at that.
It's a Christmas miracle.

00:20:51.458 --> 00:20:55.461
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to be with you.

00:20:55.629 --> 00:20:57.380
I missed you so much.

00:20:57.547 --> 00:21:00.841
- Hey, hey, uh, who'd you miss the most?
- Monica.

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:03.928
Gotcha.

00:21:06.473 --> 00:21:10.935
- I never wanna leave you again.
- But I thought if you left, you'd get fired.

00:21:11.144 --> 00:21:14.605
Turns out they can't fire me.
Because I quit.

00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:18.526
- What?
- What? You...? You really quit your job?

00:21:18.735 --> 00:21:22.196
Yeah. It was a stupid job,
and I could not stand leaving you.

00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:24.740
And why should I be the only one
who doesn't get to do...

00:21:24.908 --> 00:21:26.200
...what he really wants to do?

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:31.330
- Well, what do you really wanna do?
- I have not thought this through.

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:35.501
- Oh, my God.
- I know. I should've talked to you first.

00:21:35.711 --> 00:21:38.879
No, I think that this is what
you wanna do. I think it's great.

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.674
Thanks.

00:21:41.883 --> 00:21:46.971
Chandler, your being here is the best
Christmas present I could ever imagine.

00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:48.306
Aw.

00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:51.017
- Now give me my real gift.
- Yeah.

00:21:51.184 --> 00:21:53.227
- Thank you.
- Here, pass those around.

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:55.771
Oh, hey.

00:22:01.611 --> 00:22:05.906
"A donation has been made in your name
to the New York City Ballet."

00:22:07.659 --> 00:22:09.994
How did you know?

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:14.165
What? Are you kidding?
I can't return this.

00:22:15.334 --> 00:22:17.710
I thought it was time we started
thinking about other people.

00:22:17.878 --> 00:22:20.338
And besides, this gift still says
I love you guys.

00:22:20.547 --> 00:22:24.342
- Mine says, "To Lillian Myers."
- I don't have a job.

00:22:29.556 --> 00:22:32.141
Actuary? No.

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:35.644
Bookkeeper? Hmm, no.

00:22:35.812 --> 00:22:38.397
Topless dancer?

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.365
Hey, you know what I just realized?
You are the sole wage earner.

00:22:47.532 --> 00:22:53.037
You are the head of the household.
I don't do anything. I'm a kept man.

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:54.747
You are.

00:22:54.915 --> 00:22:56.332
Honey, here's 20 bucks.

00:22:56.625 --> 00:22:59.251
Go buy yourself something pretty
while I'm at work tomorrow.
