WEBVTT

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.671
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:00:06.214 --> 00:00:07.840
- Where's Mon?
- She's at home...

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.843
...putting up decorations
for Rachel's birthday party tonight.

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.220
- And you're not helping?
- I tried...

00:00:13.388 --> 00:00:17.307
...but apparently singing "I Will Survive"
in a helium voice, not helping.

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:21.770
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.231
Happy birth...

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:27.067
Shh. Don't say that loud.
Gunther's gonna want to hug me.

00:00:29.738 --> 00:00:31.947
Uh, good news, everyone.
We finally found a nanny.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:37.119
- This is Molly. Molly, Chandler, Joey.
- Hi.

00:00:37.287 --> 00:00:39.747
Ooh, somebody's getting a little fussy.

00:00:39.956 --> 00:00:43.375
You're damn right I am. I've been
waiting for a cookie for seven minutes.

00:00:44.586 --> 00:00:46.920
Okay. You know what,
I'm just gonna take her outside.

00:00:47.088 --> 00:00:49.423
- No, you stay. I'll do it.
- Okay. Thank you.

00:00:49.591 --> 00:00:53.010
- Nice to meet you guys.
- Yeah, you too.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:55.846
- Wow, Molly's just great.
- Yeah.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:59.058
Yes, bravo on the hot nanny.

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:02.561
- What? You really think she's hot?
- Are you kidding?

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:06.065
If I wasn't married,
she'd be rejecting me right now.

00:01:08.318 --> 00:01:09.443
Joey?

00:01:09.694 --> 00:01:11.487
How do you think she's doing?

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.116
Am I the only one that doesn't think
she's hot? Ross?

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:20.913
- Ah, I mean, she's not unattractive, but...
- Right.

00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:23.499
...but hot? Ah...

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.751
Thank you. Ha, ha.

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:29.296
Now that Rachel's gone?

00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:32.049
So hot,
I cried myself to sleep last night.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.105
Hey, Mike, what's the capital of Peru?

00:02:28.273 --> 00:02:30.899
- Lima.
- No.

00:02:32.902 --> 00:02:35.863
It starts with a V and ends with an X.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.908
And hopefully with a T-O
in the middle.

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:43.787
You know, come to think of it,
the capital of Peru is "Vtox."

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.499
- Oh, God!
- What?

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.960
Okay. I don't want to freak you out
or anything...

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:52.004
...but I just saw a rat in your cupboard.

00:02:52.213 --> 00:02:54.673
Oh, yeah. No, that's Bob.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:58.343
Well, he's your pet rat?

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:01.180
Well, not so much a pet as,
you know, an occasional visitor...

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:06.810
...who I put food out for.
You know, kind of like Santa.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:11.273
Except Santa doesn't poop
on the plate of cookies.

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:14.526
You can't keep a rat in your apartment.
They're extremely unsanitary.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:17.696
I mean, they transmit leptospirosis
and hantavirus.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.448
- What are those?
- I don't know...

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:22.075
...but they don't sound
like spa treatments.

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:24.786
- You have to get rid of it.
- Okay, fine.

00:03:24.954 --> 00:03:27.247
If it means that much to you,
I'll get rid of Bob.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.124
Thank you.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:33.045
It's so weird you think he's so gross,
yet you're willing to eat his crackers.

00:03:40.595 --> 00:03:42.471
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:45.349
Gavin, I just want to say
thank you again...

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:48.560
...for watching Emma yesterday
during the presentation.

00:03:48.728 --> 00:03:50.604
I really owe you an apology.

00:03:50.897 --> 00:03:53.649
- For what?
- When we first met, you know...

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:57.319
...I thought you were pompous
and arrogant and obnoxious.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.197
Is this your first apology?

00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:03.617
No, I just mean, you know,
first impressions don't mean anything.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:08.705
And I think you're a really good guy.
And I'm sorry that I misjudged you.

00:04:08.873 --> 00:04:11.250
- Morning.
- Hello.

00:04:11.417 --> 00:04:14.586
But you know what?
Hey, new day, new leaf.

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:18.423
I am just really, really happy...

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:22.719
I'm sorry. Obviously, Heather's ass
has something more important to say...

00:04:22.887 --> 00:04:25.681
...so I'll just wait till it's finished.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.100
- What?
- I was giving you an apology...

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:30.269
...and you were totally checking her out.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:34.439
I wasn't checking her out. I'm in fashion.
I was looking at her skirt.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:39.236
Or was it pants? I didn't really see
what happened below the ass area.

00:04:40.154 --> 00:04:42.698
Wow, you are really...
You're really a creep.

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:44.992
What do you even care
if I was looking at her?

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.493
Are you jealous?

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.370
Oh, yeah. I'm jealous.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.873
"Oh, Gavin. Please,
please look at my ass."

00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:55.669
Stop looking at my ass.

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.588
I mean, I just think
you are totally inappropriate. Okay?

00:04:58.756 --> 00:05:02.134
This is a work environment.
She's your subordinate.

00:05:02.343 --> 00:05:05.846
But it was okay when you
slept with your old assistant, Tag?

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:09.266
That is totally different for two reasons.

00:05:09.434 --> 00:05:12.894
One, I didn't know that you knew that.

00:05:14.188 --> 00:05:17.816
And two, I wasn't some creep
staring at his ass.

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:22.446
We had a... We had a deep,
meaningful relationship.

00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:25.949
Huh. What was Tag's last name?

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.868
It was...

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.538
Oh, my God.

00:05:31.706 --> 00:05:35.250
He didn't have a last name.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:41.089
It was just Tag, you know,
like Cher or...

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.925
...you know, Moses.

00:05:45.386 --> 00:05:47.804
But it was a deep,
meaningful relationship.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:51.016
You know what? My first impression
of you was absolutely right.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.977
You are arrogant. You are pompous.
Morgan! Morgan!

00:05:54.145 --> 00:05:56.938
- Tag's last name was Morgan! Ha!
- It was Jones.

00:05:57.148 --> 00:05:59.775
What are you, his boyfriend?

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:07.783
- Man, I wish I had a nanny like you.
- You mean when you were a baby?

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:09.951
Sure.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.414
Would you stop staring at her?

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:17.125
I wasn't staring.

00:06:17.293 --> 00:06:19.711
I was leering.

00:06:20.254 --> 00:06:22.130
What's the big deal with her?

00:06:22.298 --> 00:06:25.384
Maybe she's attractive
in an obvious kind of way.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:28.887
Yeah, obvious beauty's the worst.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.681
You know, when it's right there
in your face.

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:34.643
Me, I like to have to work
to find someone attractive.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.645
Makes me feel like I earned it.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.940
Looks like Joey's doing all right
with her.

00:06:40.358 --> 00:06:42.567
Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys
to back off...

00:06:42.735 --> 00:06:45.862
...and let Joey get the girl for once.

00:06:47.156 --> 00:06:50.826
- I'm gonna take her to the apartment.
- Okay, I'll be home right after work.

00:06:50.993 --> 00:06:53.412
- Okay.
- Okay, bye, Emma-wemma-demma.

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:57.040
I lovey-wovey-dove you.

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.542
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:01.169
They've elected me to talk to you
about the baby talk.

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:03.713
It's not so good.

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:06.133
I think it's sweet.

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:08.468
Bye, Emma-wemma!

00:07:10.304 --> 00:07:15.308
Hey, listen, Joey. About Molly, I would
really prefer if you didn't go after her.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:16.560
Why not?

00:07:16.727 --> 00:07:18.562
Because it took months
to find a good nanny.

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:22.566
And I wouldn't want anything to,
you know, drive her away.

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.818
So you think I'm just
gonna sleep with her...

00:07:24.986 --> 00:07:28.280
...and never call her again, and
things are gonna get uncomfortable?

00:07:28.448 --> 00:07:30.574
Yeah, that sounds about right.

00:07:31.451 --> 00:07:33.785
Come on, there are plenty
of other women out there, okay?

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:38.915
Just forget about her, okay?
She's off-limits.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:42.252
Oh, man. What'd you have to go
and say that for?

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:46.131
Now that you told me I can't have her,
makes me want her even more!

00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:49.551
- What are you, a child?
- Yes.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.179
Look, Joey, come on now.
For me, please.

00:07:52.346 --> 00:07:57.267
Just try to focus your sexual energy
on someone else.

00:07:57.727 --> 00:07:59.394
Fine.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:08.361
Take me home.

00:08:13.618 --> 00:08:16.036
- Hey, Mikey.
- Hey, Pheeb.

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:18.663
- What are you doing?
- Setting rattraps.

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:23.460
- To kill Bob?
- No. No, to test his neck strength.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:26.922
But no, I don't want to kill him.
I thought we were gonna capture him...

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:29.716
...and, you know,
set him free in the countryside...

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:31.801
...where he could meet
a friendly possum...

00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:34.888
...and a wisecracking owl.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:38.934
- Okay, okay. I'll throw away the traps.
- All right, I'll find Bob. I'll get him.

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:43.230
Bob? Bob?

00:08:43.397 --> 00:08:45.815
Robert?

00:08:47.485 --> 00:08:49.194
Wait, I think I hear him.

00:08:50.988 --> 00:08:56.117
Oh, my God! Bob had babies!
Bob's a mom!

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:57.869
We'll have to think of a new name.

00:08:58.037 --> 00:09:00.497
Oh, I don't know,
I kind of like "Bob" for a girl.

00:09:00.665 --> 00:09:02.415
No, no. I mean, I'm not sure that we...

00:09:05.586 --> 00:09:09.506
Oh, my God. We killed Bob?

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:12.342
Well, maybe it wasn't Bob.
Maybe it was a mouse.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.886
Susie?

00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:21.142
What's up?

00:09:22.353 --> 00:09:24.479
Seriously, dude. Three years ago.

00:09:26.315 --> 00:09:29.276
Listen, can you do me a favor?
I'm gonna be out today.

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:30.860
Can you keep an eye on Joey...

00:09:31.028 --> 00:09:33.613
...make sure nothing happens
between him and Molly?

00:09:33.823 --> 00:09:35.949
- You don't trust him?
- Well, no.

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:38.868
Some woman who sounded
a lot like Joey called earlier...

00:09:39.036 --> 00:09:42.914
...and asked for her daughter,
uh, the "hot nanny."

00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:46.376
Is this really your long-term plan,
for me to run interference?

00:09:46.544 --> 00:09:50.213
Because I could get a job any day now.

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:53.967
You do appear right on the cusp
of something.

00:09:54.135 --> 00:09:57.345
Look, come on, man. I'm sure
he'll lose interest in a week or two...

00:09:57.555 --> 00:10:00.015
...but for now, could you please
just do this for me?

00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:02.100
Fine, but don't blame me
if it doesn't work.

00:10:02.268 --> 00:10:04.894
Because you know once Joey
sets his mind on something...

00:10:05.062 --> 00:10:08.523
...more often than not,
he's going to have sex with it.

00:10:09.942 --> 00:10:12.652
Well, I mean,
we've gotta do something. Okay?

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.323
Nannies like her don't grow on trees.

00:10:18.993 --> 00:10:21.202
- Picturing that tree?
- I am, yes.

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:31.046
Where you going, Joe?

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:37.135
For a walk.

00:10:37.303 --> 00:10:39.304
Oh, you mind if I join you?

00:10:39.555 --> 00:10:44.851
Actually, uh, I'd rather be alone. You know,
I really need to organize my thoughts.

00:10:46.103 --> 00:10:48.355
Your thoughts?

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.357
Plural?

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:55.070
All right, fine. I only have one thought.

00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.906
It's about the hot nanny. I gotta see her.

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:02.452
- I'm afraid I can't let you do that, Joe.
- Now you're telling me I can't see her?

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:07.123
You guys are killing me.
She's forbidden fruit. It's like, like...

00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:11.086
Like she's the princess
and I'm the stable boy.

00:11:12.797 --> 00:11:14.673
Why are you doing this, huh?

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.092
Did Ross tell you not to let me
go over there?

00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:20.011
Yes, as a matter of fact, he did.
So I can't let you go.

00:11:20.221 --> 00:11:24.057
Huh. Interesting.
Now there are obstacles.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:28.728
Hot nanny and me against the world.

00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:31.022
This is the stuff great novels
are made of.

00:11:31.232 --> 00:11:33.817
- Great novels?
- Fine. Mediocre porn.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.824
- Gavin Mitchell's office.
- Rachel Green's office.

00:11:40.991 --> 00:11:42.534
Give me that phone.

00:11:43.994 --> 00:11:47.414
Hello, this is Rachel Green.
How can I help you?

00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:52.752
Uh-huh. Okay, then.
I'll pass you back to your son.

00:11:53.921 --> 00:11:56.756
Hey, Mom. No, that's just my secretary.

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.846
Um, excuse me, Gavin.
I have a question I need to ask you.

00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:06.057
Mom, I'll call you later. Yeah.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.728
- Yes?
- If you like looking at butts so much...

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:13.356
...why don't you just go
look in a mirror?

00:12:14.233 --> 00:12:15.650
Thank God you finally said that.

00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:19.112
I saw you make a note on your pad
three hours ago.

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:24.534
- Man, I really bug you. Don't I?
- Oh, no. Please...

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:26.536
...I don't care about you
enough to bug me.

00:12:26.704 --> 00:12:30.206
In fact, from now on,
I'm going to take the high road...

00:12:30.374 --> 00:12:33.877
...and I'm going to be very, very nice
to you, you mama's boy...

00:12:34.044 --> 00:12:35.378
...starting right now.

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:39.090
- Hey, Rach.
- Hi.

00:12:39.258 --> 00:12:41.092
- Ready for your birthday lunch?
- I am.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.345
But first, Monica,
I would like to introduce you...

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:47.682
...to my very talented colleague
and more importantly...

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:50.685
...my wonderful friend, Gavin Mitchell.

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.687
- Pleased to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:54.397
Are you coming to Rachel's party?

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:57.984
Oh, no, no, no. Gavin can't.
He already has plans...

00:12:58.152 --> 00:13:00.612
...most likely with his mother.

00:13:01.238 --> 00:13:05.533
I don't mind. I'll cancel them. I would
never miss my secretary's birthday.

00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:11.790
Why did you invite him?
I can't stand that guy.

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:14.459
- You were being so nice to him.
- I was faking it.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:16.461
Can't you tell when I'm being fake?

00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:20.089
Hey, Mr. Phillips. Nice suit.

00:13:20.257 --> 00:13:23.218
- Right there. That was so fake!
- Shh!

00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.562
Oh, hi.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:36.773
I still can't believe you invited Gavin.

00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:39.734
I mean, he is just the last person
I want to see.

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:43.530
You're welcome for the party.
I'm glad you're having a good time.

00:13:43.697 --> 00:13:47.408
God, I hope he doesn't show up. Of course
he's not gonna show up, the guy hates me.

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:49.619
- Does he?
- What?

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:53.122
Maybe he keeps bothering you
so much because he likes you.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.000
It's like in first grade
when Skippy Lange would push me...

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:58.628
...because he secretly
had a crush on me.

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:02.048
Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you?

00:14:02.216 --> 00:14:05.510
Honey, all those boys had a bet
to see if he could knock you over.

00:14:07.555 --> 00:14:10.640
- She's out. I'm gonna take her home.
- Oh, okay. Thank you.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:12.851
Bye, sweetheart.

00:14:16.021 --> 00:14:18.565
Do you see what all the guys see in her?

00:14:18.732 --> 00:14:21.276
Wouldn't kick her out of bed.

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:23.236
No more vodka for me.

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:27.574
Hey, Rach. So can I sing
"Happy Birthday" to you now?

00:14:27.741 --> 00:14:30.159
- Yeah, sure.
- Oh. All right.

00:14:30.327 --> 00:14:31.494
Happy birth...

00:14:32.955 --> 00:14:35.039
See you later.

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.792
Hey, Rach. Somebody got you shoes.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.168
Give me.

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:45.758
- Wow. Wow. Oh, my God!
- Careful! Careful!

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:48.303
These are my rat babies!

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:54.475
Yeah. We have rat babies now.

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:59.689
Oh, you brought rats
to my birthday party?

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:02.817
So this is what a stroke feels like.

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:05.361
Well, I had to bring them.
We killed their mother.

00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:07.780
They're our responsibility now.

00:15:07.948 --> 00:15:09.908
You know, they require constant care.

00:15:10.075 --> 00:15:11.910
You should know that, Rachel,
you're a mother.

00:15:13.746 --> 00:15:16.623
Are you comparing my daughter to a rat?

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:18.791
No. Seven rats.

00:15:20.377 --> 00:15:22.670
I think we should take them home.
We need to feed them.

00:15:22.838 --> 00:15:25.632
Wait, you're gonna leave my party
to take care of a box of rats?

00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:28.217
Well, I'm sorry, Rachel,
but I'm not like you. Okay?

00:15:28.385 --> 00:15:31.054
Not everyone can afford help.

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:40.396
Hey, where the hell are Joey and Molly?

00:15:40.564 --> 00:15:42.065
I asked you to watch them.

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:44.776
I'm sorry. I got a little preoccupied.

00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:48.947
Look, we have to stop them
before something happens.

00:15:49.281 --> 00:15:51.950
Right behind you, big guy.

00:15:53.744 --> 00:15:56.037
So you see, Molly,
what people don't understand...

00:15:56.246 --> 00:15:59.916
...is that acting is a discipline.
It takes a lot of hard work.

00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:03.002
- So where'd you study?
- Oh, I didn't go to college.

00:16:03.212 --> 00:16:09.092
- No, where'd you study acting?
- Molly, people don't study acting.

00:16:11.971 --> 00:16:15.765
Molly, uh, do you mind giving us
just a minute?

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.226
- Sure. I'll go check on Emma.
- Thanks.

00:16:20.187 --> 00:16:23.231
Will the stable boy
never get the princess?

00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:27.735
What do you think you were gonna do,
have sex with her here on my couch?

00:16:27.945 --> 00:16:31.155
No. The leather sticks to my ass.

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:35.535
This isn't fair. What makes you think
I'm gonna sleep with her...

00:16:35.703 --> 00:16:37.286
...and then blow her off, huh?

00:16:37.454 --> 00:16:41.708
Can't you guys open your minds to
the possibility that I actually like her...

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:43.876
...and might want something real?

00:16:45.462 --> 00:16:50.466
Look, the truth is I haven't felt
this way about anyone since Rachel.

00:16:50.634 --> 00:16:53.970
Okay?
I didn't think I could ever love again.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:56.431
- Come on.
- Joe.

00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:04.647
Hi. Is Molly here?

00:17:04.815 --> 00:17:07.025
Uh, yeah, yeah. Come on in. Molly?

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:12.739
- Hey. Guys, this is Tabitha.
- Hey.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:16.993
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:31.340
Uh, well, Joey, I guess
we have no problem.

00:17:32.426 --> 00:17:36.304
It's like my favorite fairy tale come true.

00:17:37.639 --> 00:17:41.017
The princess, the stable boy
and the lesbian.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.773
Okay. Okay,
you start preparing the formula...

00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.649
...and I'll start changing the box.

00:17:48.817 --> 00:17:51.944
And then we gotta put them
straight to bed.

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:54.030
When did we become
one of those couples...

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:56.699
...whose lives revolve around their rats?

00:17:58.327 --> 00:18:01.037
Well, you know what?
They're our responsibility now.

00:18:01.246 --> 00:18:04.749
Okay, fine.
These rats are our responsibility.

00:18:04.958 --> 00:18:07.335
What happens when they mate
and there are hundreds?

00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:10.505
Mate? They're all brothers and sisters.

00:18:10.839 --> 00:18:13.299
Yeah, uh, not such a problem with rats.

00:18:13.467 --> 00:18:16.886
No, they're more of a "love the one
you're with" kind of animal.

00:18:17.679 --> 00:18:19.764
No. Really?

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:23.392
Oh, my... Get off your sister! Ew.

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:27.605
Oh, my God. What are we gonna do?

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:30.900
- The... We have seven rats.
- Uh-huh.

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:33.694
So, what if each of them
has seven rats...

00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:37.824
...and then each of those
have seven rats? That's like...

00:18:40.911 --> 00:18:44.038
That's math I can't even do.

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.999
What are we gonna do?

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.627
Well, I know this is gonna
sound crazy...

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:56.384
...but we could
not let the box of rats ruin our lives.

00:18:58.428 --> 00:19:02.014
Yeah, okay. I guess you're right.

00:19:02.182 --> 00:19:05.518
All right, so we should just
give them away.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:11.649
But to nice families with children
and reduced-fat Wheat Thins.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:14.193
Those were Bob's favorites.

00:19:14.361 --> 00:19:16.279
It's gonna be okay.

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:21.367
- You must think I'm crazy.
- No, I think you're sweet.

00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:23.035
Good.

00:19:23.537 --> 00:19:24.787
This is just so hard.

00:19:24.955 --> 00:19:28.374
It's hard for me to let them go.

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:31.711
I guess it just brings back memories,
you know...

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:37.550
...from when I gave birth to my brother's
triplets and I had to give them up.

00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:45.975
I haven't told you about that yet, have I?

00:19:55.986 --> 00:19:58.279
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:19:58.447 --> 00:20:01.741
Thanks for the party, honey.
Should I help you clean up?

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:06.078
No way. You had your party.
Now I have mine.

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:11.459
- Is everything all right?
- I just get bummed...

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:13.127
...when my birthday's over.

00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:15.922
Well, at least you have one thing
to be happy about.

00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:18.424
- Mm?
- That jerk, Gavin, from your office...

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:19.967
...didn't show up.
- Ah.

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:22.220
Yeah, I hate him.

00:20:24.806 --> 00:20:27.934
We weren't talking about you.
We were...

00:20:28.101 --> 00:20:31.729
No. No way to recover. No. Okay.

00:20:33.649 --> 00:20:37.109
- Fun party.
- Well, it was.

00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:40.071
And you would have seen it
if you didn't show up at...

00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:45.743
Nine-thirty? God.
Ugh, this party was lame.

00:20:46.078 --> 00:20:48.829
Again, you're welcome.

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:53.709
- Look, I'll just give you this and go.
- Oh, you bought me a present. Why?

00:20:54.878 --> 00:20:58.589
Let me explain how birthday parties
usually work. There are presents...

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:01.592
...and a cake,
perhaps a fourth or fifth person.

00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:05.888
Okay, I, uh...

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:09.433
I got you the present to make up
for being such a jerk to you.

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:15.189
Aw. Well, okay. Well, that's very nice.
And you wrote a card.

00:21:16.108 --> 00:21:18.567
- "From Gavin."
- I really mean it.

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:25.658
Oh. Oh.

00:21:25.826 --> 00:21:27.368
Oh, it's beautiful.

00:21:27.577 --> 00:21:29.787
- If you don't mind? Let me.
- No.

00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:35.334
Well, what do you know, it fits.

00:21:37.337 --> 00:21:41.757
See, Gavin. You're capable of being
a nice guy.

00:21:41.925 --> 00:21:44.010
Why do you give me such a hard time?

00:21:45.262 --> 00:21:46.804
I'm not sure.

00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:52.018
Well, Monica seems to think
it's because you have feelings for me.

00:21:52.227 --> 00:21:54.312
I do have feelings for you.

00:21:56.189 --> 00:21:59.358
- You do?
- Yes. I feel that you're a little annoying.

00:22:00.819 --> 00:22:02.153
See, why? Gavin, why?

00:22:02.404 --> 00:22:06.449
Right when I'm about to change
my opinion of you, you go and you...

00:22:10.203 --> 00:22:12.538
And you do that.

00:22:30.557 --> 00:22:35.686
First I was afraid, I was petrified

00:22:39.816 --> 00:22:41.150
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:22:41.318 --> 00:22:43.110
Listen, um, I think I left something here.

00:22:43.362 --> 00:22:46.614
Oh. Uh, well, somebody left this.
Is this yours?

00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:48.991
Oh. No, but I like it.

00:22:50.702 --> 00:22:53.162
No, I think I left one of my rat babies.

00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:57.792
Oh. Uh, well, no. I haven't seen it,
but if I do, I'll let you know.

00:22:57.959 --> 00:23:01.253
Aah! Rat baby! Rat baby! Rat baby!
Rat baby!

00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:03.881
Maybe that's him.
