WEBVTT

00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:06.549
Have you seen our bank statement?
Can this be right?

00:00:06.716 --> 00:00:10.469
I know. God, I haven't seen
my savings take a hit like this...

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:14.390
...since I was a kid and they came up
with Double Stuf Oreos.

00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:19.270
- What happened to all of our money?
- Well, I'm not sure exactly what they did...

00:00:19.437 --> 00:00:22.064
...but I'm inclined to blame Enron.

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:25.651
Well,
I guess with you doing the internship...

00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:28.362
...we're just spending more
than we're bringing in.

00:00:28.696 --> 00:00:32.408
Yeah, maybe I should quit
and get a job that pays.

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:35.286
But you're finally doing something
that you love.

00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:37.830
I mean, I can't ask you to give that up.

00:00:37.997 --> 00:00:41.667
Although it would be nice if the thing
that you loved was, you know, finding gold.

00:00:43.294 --> 00:00:45.838
You know what? I think we're making
too big a deal out of this.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:47.923
Okay? So we pay our bills late
this month.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.134
Maybe next month,
we cut back on a few things.

00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:54.305
And maybe we start eating
out of Joey's refrigerator for a change.

00:00:54.722 --> 00:00:58.809
You're a chef. What can you make
out of baking soda and beer?

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.063
All right. Worst-case scenario is,
we borrow some money from my parents.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.981
No, we're not borrowing money.

00:01:04.148 --> 00:01:07.109
- Why not?
- Because we don't do that. We are Bings.

00:01:09.153 --> 00:01:11.781
If there's one thing my father
taught me, it was...

00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:15.743
...well, to always knock
before going into the pool house.

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:18.913
But the other thing was,
never borrow money.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.832
Wow, I had no idea
you had this much pride.

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:23.918
That's right, I do. I am your man.

00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:25.878
And I'm gonna get us
through this situation...

00:01:26.045 --> 00:01:28.130
...even if it means you working
twice as hard.

00:02:09.797 --> 00:02:11.882
- I'm gonna go.
- Why?

00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:14.969
I haven't been home in a couple days
and I need to get more clothes.

00:02:15.136 --> 00:02:17.972
You don't have to go.
I have something that'll fit you.

00:02:19.098 --> 00:02:22.309
I put that tube top on as a joke.

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:26.105
- I want you to stay.
- I want to stay too.

00:02:26.272 --> 00:02:28.858
But I've got as much use
out of these boxers as I can.

00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:31.235
- Why don't you turn them inside...
- Done it.

00:02:32.945 --> 00:02:36.031
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- All right. I'll miss you.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.117
Me too.

00:02:42.454 --> 00:02:46.041
You know what? I just realized
something. I don't want to go home.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.546
- Great! Okay, I'll go get the tube top.
- No, no, what I mean is...

00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:53.507
- ...I hate going back to my apartment now.
- Mm-hm.

00:02:53.674 --> 00:02:56.510
Partly because I live above
a known crack den...

00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:01.348
...but, you know, mostly because
when I'm there, I really miss you.

00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:04.768
So...

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:07.479
...do you want to move in together?

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:11.859
Wow, Mike Hannigan...

00:03:12.026 --> 00:03:15.237
...you sure know how to
make a girl say "Hell, yeah."

00:03:15.863 --> 00:03:19.450
- So we're doing it?
- Yeah, let's do it. Let's live together.

00:03:21.452 --> 00:03:23.662
Wow.
We're really gonna move in together?

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:24.872
Yeah.

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:27.541
I've always wanted to live with a guy.

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:31.253
Pick up your socks.
Put down the toilet seat.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.548
No, we are not having sex anymore.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.635
It's gonna be fun.

00:03:39.887 --> 00:03:42.473
- Hey, JOEY-
- Hey.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.894
Listen, I need to know
that what I'm about to ask you...

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:49.271
...will never get back to Chandler.

00:03:53.108 --> 00:03:56.195
I'd be lying if I said
I hadn't thought about it myself.

00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:02.618
But Chandler is my best friend.
It would be wrong.

00:04:03.327 --> 00:04:06.413
Good, but wrong.

00:04:07.665 --> 00:04:11.168
Okay, first of all, it would be great.

00:04:11.335 --> 00:04:14.713
But that's not what I'm here to talk
to you about. I need to borrow money.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.133
Oh, I don't know, Monica. You know...

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.302
...lending friends money
is always a mistake.

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:24.014
- But Chandler lent you money.
- And he would tell you it was a mistake.

00:04:24.932 --> 00:04:28.602
Come on, I just... I need it
for some rent and some other bills.

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:31.397
Oh, well... Well, how much?

00:04:32.022 --> 00:04:35.025
- Two thousand dollars?
- Two thousand dollars?

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:37.611
What do you think I am,
a soap-opera star?

00:04:38.821 --> 00:04:41.573
- Yeah.
- That's right, I am.

00:04:44.201 --> 00:04:46.412
- Hi, you guys.
- Hey.

00:04:46.578 --> 00:04:50.165
- What's in the bag?
- You know how Emma started crawling?

00:04:50.332 --> 00:04:54.253
I realized that this place
is very unsafe for a baby...

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.257
...so I went to the store and I got some
stuff to baby-proof the apartment.

00:04:58.424 --> 00:05:00.467
Oh, God, baby-proofing.

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:04.221
Why is it such a big deal now?
You know, when I was a kid, it was like:

00:05:04.388 --> 00:05:06.807
"Whoops, Joey fell down the stairs."

00:05:06.974 --> 00:05:11.895
Or, "Whoops,
Joey electrocuted himself again."

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:16.692
Anyway, um, are you going to get
a handyman to install this stuff?

00:05:16.859 --> 00:05:20.487
- No, I was just gonna do it myself.
- Ha, ha.

00:05:22.656 --> 00:05:25.659
- You're gonna do it'?
- Yeah. Why?

00:05:25.826 --> 00:05:30.497
- You don't think a woman can do this?
- Women can. You can't.

00:05:31.665 --> 00:05:35.836
Monica, will you please tell Joey
that he is a pig.

00:05:36.003 --> 00:05:39.715
- You're a pig. And you can't do this.
- What?

00:05:39.882 --> 00:05:43.427
What? Come on, I found
the hardware store all by myself.

00:05:43.594 --> 00:05:45.429
The hardware store's
right down the street.

00:05:45.596 --> 00:05:48.474
There is a hardware store
right down the street?

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:55.064
Hey, you guys?
Okay, we've got great news.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.567
- Phoebe and I are moving in together.
- Congratulations.

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:02.321
I know, it's so exciting. You know,
I've never lived with a guy before.

00:06:02.488 --> 00:06:06.408
Well, it's just like living with a girl,
only they don't steal your makeup.

00:06:06.575 --> 00:06:09.995
Unless they're playing
"This ls What My Sister Would Look Like."

00:06:10.913 --> 00:06:13.415
Yeah, she's not so cute.

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:17.294
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
- Well, you put down the toilet seat.

00:06:17.503 --> 00:06:19.505
Yes, dear.

00:06:20.464 --> 00:06:23.884
- Is that a bit you guys do?
- Uh-huh. We're playing you two.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.515
We don't do that.
Tell her we don't do that.

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.683
Yes, dear.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.397
I can't believe you're moving in together.
That's gre... I'm happy for you guys.

00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:39.733
- I hear wedding bells.
- Monica, slow down, okay?

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.486
I'm just excited to be living with him.

00:06:42.653 --> 00:06:44.780
You know, I mean, I don't know...

00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:48.283
...can I see someday being
married to Mike? Sure. Yeah.

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.744
You know, I could picture myself
walking down the aisle...

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:55.541
...in a wedding dress that highlights
my breasts in an obvious yet classy way.

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.462
But do I want that house in Connecticut,
you know, near the good schools...

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:04.508
...where Mike and I could send
little Sophie and Mike Jr.?

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:07.219
Oh, my God, I do.

00:07:07.845 --> 00:07:10.639
Phoebe, I had no idea
you were so conventional.

00:07:10.806 --> 00:07:12.474
I know. I guess I am.

00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:16.186
Oh, my God, load up the Volvo,
I want to be a soccer mom.

00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:20.941
- You ready to go?
- Yeah, you bet, roomie.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.902
Don't you mean "groomie"?

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:27.865
- What are you talking about?
- Please.

00:07:28.031 --> 00:07:29.825
These guys.
We haven't even moved in yet...

00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:32.244
...and they have us picking out
china patterns.

00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:42.421
China patterns!

00:07:45.716 --> 00:07:49.678
This is easy. "Can't do this..."

00:07:53.974 --> 00:07:56.477
Wow, seriously. Can't do this.

00:08:02.483 --> 00:08:03.650
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey.

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:08.113
Listen, um, I need to ask you a favor,
and we can't tell Monica anything about it.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.743
- I thought you guys didn't have secrets.
- That will remain the official party line.

00:08:15.787 --> 00:08:18.999
Look, Monica and I are having
a little financial trouble.

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.919
- Yeah, I know.
- What? What do you mean, you "know"?

00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:24.213
Uh...

00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:26.381
I just figured it out, you know?

00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:30.219
I mean, you're not working
and, uh, the economy is bad.

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:32.763
Oh, right.

00:08:32.930 --> 00:08:36.266
That is the fastest I have ever thought.

00:08:37.768 --> 00:08:39.561
Anyway, uh...

00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:43.190
...I need to borrow some money.

00:08:43.357 --> 00:08:46.151
Oh, sure. Yeah, how much?
Two thousand dollars?

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:51.365
Yes, $2000 exactly.
How did you know that?

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:57.079
Uh, well, I know how much
you used to make...

00:08:57.246 --> 00:08:59.248
...and I know how much your rent is.

00:09:00.082 --> 00:09:02.167
Oh, okay.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:04.711
I am on fire.

00:09:05.754 --> 00:09:08.382
Listen, this is really nice.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:13.345
Did you write a check to Monica
for $2000?

00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:15.222
Did Monica borrow money from you?

00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:19.935
- Uh, kind of.
- I can't believe her.

00:09:20.102 --> 00:09:22.104
Did she tell you we were having
money problems?

00:09:22.312 --> 00:09:25.232
No, no, no. It wasn't because
of your money problems.

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:28.443
It was for something for her.

00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:30.320
What?

00:09:30.487 --> 00:09:31.655
Something personal.

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:34.825
What would she get for $2000
that she wouldn't tell me about?

00:09:34.992 --> 00:09:36.201
Excuse me.

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.123
Boob job.

00:09:41.873 --> 00:09:44.501
I don't want her to get a boob job.
That's crazy.

00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:47.629
Well, it's not that crazy, okay?

00:09:47.796 --> 00:09:50.382
Making them smaller,
that would be crazy.

00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:57.264
Oh, hey, I wanted to ask you
about Monica's little "groomie" joke.

00:09:57.431 --> 00:10:01.310
Well, I think the reason people laughed
is that it's a play on the word "roomie."

00:10:01.518 --> 00:10:03.061
No...

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:08.817
I get the joke. Sophisticated as it was.

00:10:08.984 --> 00:10:12.362
No, the thing I want to say is...

00:10:12.988 --> 00:10:15.490
Maybe we should've
talked about this before.

00:10:15.657 --> 00:10:19.995
Us living together,
you're not expecting a proposal, right?

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.998
- Oh, no, no. Not at all.
- Okay.

00:10:23.206 --> 00:10:26.627
We're just moving in right now.
We'll see where it goes.

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:31.214
Yeah, well, that's the thing.
For me, it's as far as it can ever go.

00:10:32.132 --> 00:10:35.594
- What do you mean?
- Look, Phoebe, I...

00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:40.140
I love you very much.
But I never want to get married again.

00:10:40.724 --> 00:10:42.267
Oh.

00:10:42.809 --> 00:10:46.730
- Wow.
- It's just, my first marriage was...

00:10:46.897 --> 00:10:50.484
...you know, such a disaster that
I kind of lost faith in the whole idea.

00:10:50.651 --> 00:10:53.695
- Mm-hm. Was it really that bad?
- At one point, near the end...

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:57.699
- ...she deliberately defecated on my...
- Okay, well, that's bad. Yeah.

00:10:59.618 --> 00:11:03.872
But don't you think it might be
different with someone else? Perhaps...

00:11:04.039 --> 00:11:06.667
...a blond who always uses the toilet?

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.422
Except for once in the ocean.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:15.217
Look, it's not about who I would marry.

00:11:15.384 --> 00:11:18.929
I was certain the first time I got married
it would last forever. I was wrong.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.807
- But, it just...
- Look, Phoebe, it's not about you.

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.267
I just never want to get married again.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:28.980
- Ah.
- I'm sorry.

00:11:29.606 --> 00:11:34.069
Are you okay with that? If not, maybe
us moving in together isn't the best idea.

00:11:34.653 --> 00:11:37.739
No. Oh, I definitely don't
want to get married.

00:11:37.906 --> 00:11:41.785
No, I just wanted to make sure
you didn't want to, too.

00:11:43.078 --> 00:11:45.914
Because, you know, if we move in
and you start changing your mind...

00:11:46.081 --> 00:11:48.041
...there is gonna be hell to pay, mister.

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:51.670
- Trust me. I will never...
- Yeah, I get that. Yeah.

00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:02.973
Hi. So you gave in
and decided to call someone?

00:12:03.181 --> 00:12:07.477
Yeah. I don't know who I was kidding.
I can barely use chopsticks.

00:12:08.145 --> 00:12:10.689
- You're all set.
- Oh, thank you so much.

00:12:10.897 --> 00:12:13.191
Wait. You forgot your, um...

00:12:13.358 --> 00:12:15.777
Your game.

00:12:15.944 --> 00:12:17.529
Thank you.

00:12:20.073 --> 00:12:24.786
Hey, Rach. There she is,
my perfectly proportioned wife.

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:29.666
Don't look at me. I never get his jokes.

00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:32.961
- Thank you?
- No, no. Don't thank me.

00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:37.090
Thank you. Do you know there is not
one thing that I would change about you?

00:12:37.299 --> 00:12:40.552
Not one single thing.
And definitely not...

00:12:40.719 --> 00:12:43.096
...two single things.

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:46.391
Okay, you're being weird.
Do you want sex...

00:12:46.558 --> 00:12:48.477
...or did you do something bad?

00:12:48.643 --> 00:12:52.314
No. No. No. I just love
the way you look. I am warm...

00:12:52.481 --> 00:12:54.274
...for your form.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:13:00.155
Okay, um, you know the old classics like,
you know, "You look nice"?

00:13:00.322 --> 00:13:01.448
They're still okay.

00:13:01.865 --> 00:13:05.035
But "you look nice" could mean
that I'm saying, "Your face looks nice."

00:13:05.202 --> 00:13:07.788
I want to compliment your body.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.333
I mean, I wouldn't change it at all.

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:15.253
And more specifically, I wouldn't
want anything to get any bigger.

00:13:16.713 --> 00:13:17.964
- Okay.
- I mean...

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:21.259
...you wouldn't want any part of me
to get any bigger, would you?

00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:26.056
Don't answer that.

00:13:29.893 --> 00:13:32.896
Just when you thought that dude
couldn't get any weirder.

00:13:33.939 --> 00:13:36.817
I know. Why do you think he was
so worried about me getting bigger?

00:13:36.983 --> 00:13:39.110
I don't know.
I mean, what brought that on'?

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:43.281
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You know what?
We're trying to get pregnant...

00:13:43.448 --> 00:13:46.785
...so he's probably starting to freak out
that my body's gonna change.

00:13:46.952 --> 00:13:49.412
- You think that's what it is?
- You heard him.

00:13:49.621 --> 00:13:52.541
"No bigger. You're perfect.
Just don't get any bigger."

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:55.544
My God, he sounded just like
my high-school wrestling coach.

00:13:59.548 --> 00:14:02.676
- I'm gonna have to talk to Chandler.
- Yeah. If you don't, I will.

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:06.596
Of course your body's gonna change.
Your breasts are gonna get bigger...

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.099
...your ass is gonna get bigger...

00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:12.185
...you're gonna lose bladder control.

00:14:15.689 --> 00:14:18.191
God, it's just such a magical time.

00:14:24.656 --> 00:14:25.699
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:14:25.866 --> 00:14:28.034
Listen, I wanted to ask you
something about marriage.

00:14:28.243 --> 00:14:30.120
Now you're seeking me out
to make jokes?

00:14:30.287 --> 00:14:34.249
I mean, I can see if we're all hanging
out, but to come to my home...

00:14:34.457 --> 00:14:36.877
No, I really want to know
how you feel about it.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:40.714
- Why?
- Mike doesn't ever want to get married.

00:14:41.464 --> 00:14:43.425
- Never?
- Never.

00:14:43.592 --> 00:14:46.887
Wow. Are you still gonna
move in with him?

00:14:47.262 --> 00:14:51.808
I want to, but I wanted you to tell me
that marriage really isn't that big a deal.

00:14:51.975 --> 00:14:56.396
You know, that I won't be missing out
on anything. That marriage stinks.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.150
Yeah, marriage stinks.

00:15:01.026 --> 00:15:05.405
I mean, if you want to see a man gain
weight and a woman stop shaving...

00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.365
...get them married.

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:11.578
- That's not how you really feel, is it?
- No, I'm sorry.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:15.749
Look, I know it's not what you want to hear,
but I can't help it.

00:15:15.916 --> 00:15:17.334
I love marriage.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.753
Seriously, you? Divorce-0?

00:15:20.795 --> 00:15:25.800
If you have to call me a name, I'd prefer
"Ross, the Divorcer." It's just cooler.

00:15:27.093 --> 00:15:31.056
Look, look, I know my marriages
didn't exactly work out...

00:15:31.222 --> 00:15:34.392
...but, you know, I loved being
that committed to another person.

00:15:34.601 --> 00:15:38.521
And Carol and I had some good times
before she became a lesbian.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:41.274
And once afterward.

00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.860
Anyway, I'm sorry.

00:15:44.027 --> 00:15:46.446
Ugh. It's okay. That's how you feel.

00:15:47.906 --> 00:15:50.617
But, come on, I mean,
living together will be great.

00:15:50.784 --> 00:15:53.620
I mean, you guys have so much fun.
And you love Mike.

00:15:54.245 --> 00:15:56.498
- I do love Mike.
- Yeah, see?

00:15:56.706 --> 00:16:00.001
And you were so excited about
moving in together before...

00:16:00.168 --> 00:16:02.671
...and you know what? You should be.
It's a big deal.

00:16:03.964 --> 00:16:06.424
Yeah, I guess you're right.

00:16:06.591 --> 00:16:08.760
Yeah, thanks. This helped. Thanks.

00:16:08.969 --> 00:16:11.471
The Divorcer to the rescue.

00:16:12.263 --> 00:16:14.099
- It's not cooler.
- Yeah, I just heard it.

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:23.149
Oh.

00:16:28.738 --> 00:16:30.115
Rash?

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:40.500
Rachel?

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:56.141
So I can't do anything I like?

00:16:57.475 --> 00:16:58.852
Hey, Rach.

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:03.773
Ah, perfection.
Wouldn't change a thing. Not a thing.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:04.983
- Honey?
- Yeah?

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.776
About that.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:12.824
- Um, I'm going to change.
- Yes, but, honey, you don't have to.

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:15.118
I'm gonna get bigger.

00:17:15.326 --> 00:17:16.703
Honey, I...

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.873
I love your breasts the way they are.

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:22.751
Ugh. Fascist.

00:17:23.334 --> 00:17:26.379
Well, my breasts are gonna get bigger
whether you like it or not.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:30.050
And it's not just my breasts.
My ass is gonna get bigger too.

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:31.885
Your ass?

00:17:33.011 --> 00:17:36.181
And don't be surprised if her hands
and her feet get bigger too.

00:17:38.016 --> 00:17:41.478
- They do that?
- It's kind of a package deal.

00:17:42.896 --> 00:17:46.191
God, why? Why would you
want to do that to yourself?

00:17:46.399 --> 00:17:49.110
I thought it was something
that we both wanted.

00:17:49.611 --> 00:17:53.281
If it means that much to you, I may be
able to get on board with the big boobs...

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:55.575
...but the giant ass
and the big clown feet?

00:17:58.161 --> 00:17:59.871
Oh, my God, Chandler.

00:18:00.038 --> 00:18:03.124
If you can't handle this,
what are you gonna be like in the hospital...

00:18:03.291 --> 00:18:07.504
...with the blood and screaming and the
little person that's shooting out of her?

00:18:10.381 --> 00:18:11.758
What?

00:18:18.932 --> 00:18:22.644
Joey, why did you tell Chandler
that Monica was getting a boob job?

00:18:23.019 --> 00:18:25.522
Because she is.

00:18:25.688 --> 00:18:29.526
- Chandler knows I borrowed the money.
- Mm-hm. For your boob job.

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:31.528
- Joe...
- It's over.

00:18:31.736 --> 00:18:35.406
Okay, so I'm out $4000 and
nobody's boobs are getting any bigger?

00:18:41.162 --> 00:18:45.834
Hey. Hey, what do you guys think
about this: Ross, the Divorce Force.

00:18:47.043 --> 00:18:48.878
- Better.
- Yeah?

00:18:49.212 --> 00:18:51.089
Very cool.

00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:56.553
Hey, Pheebs? You know, I'm really glad
you came to talk to me the other day...

00:18:56.719 --> 00:18:59.764
- ...and I hope I was a little helpful.
- Oh, yeah, you were helpful.

00:18:59.931 --> 00:19:01.724
- Yeah. No, thank you.
- Good. Good.

00:19:01.933 --> 00:19:05.270
Because the more I thought about it,
the more I realized...

00:19:05.436 --> 00:19:09.107
...I don't think marriage is necessarily
the right path for you.

00:19:09.399 --> 00:19:10.525
What do you mean?

00:19:10.692 --> 00:19:12.777
I know the other day
in the coffeehouse...

00:19:12.944 --> 00:19:16.072
...you were all caught up
in the whole soccer-mom thing...

00:19:16.239 --> 00:19:20.451
...but is that really you? I mean, can you
honestly picture yourself in a Volvo?

00:19:21.578 --> 00:19:24.372
They are awfully boxy.

00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:30.420
I mean, I don't know, you'd be so bored
with marriage. I mean, it's so normal.

00:19:31.337 --> 00:19:33.715
Uh-huh. Yeah.

00:19:33.882 --> 00:19:35.466
Hey, can I help?

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:39.220
Well, we climbed up four flights of stairs,
maneuvered a narrow hallway...

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:43.725
...dodged a rabid pit bull. But these last
three feet are where it gets really tricky.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.314
You know, sometimes your words,
they hurt.

00:19:51.274 --> 00:19:53.776
Hey, where do you guys want this?

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:56.571
Yeah, seriously,
because this is really heavy.

00:19:56.738 --> 00:20:01.159
I mean, not for me, because I'm only
pretending to hold it, but for these guys.

00:20:03.036 --> 00:20:08.875
Just one last time on the marriage thing.
There's no wiggle room? None at all?

00:20:09.751 --> 00:20:12.170
No, but you don't want to
get married either, right?

00:20:12.378 --> 00:20:13.588
Right.

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:16.132
Except that I do want to get married.

00:20:16.341 --> 00:20:19.469
Couldn't have had this conversation
down at the truck, huh?

00:20:20.678 --> 00:20:22.347
What? You want to get married?

00:20:22.931 --> 00:20:24.182
Someday.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.685
And hernia.

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:35.109
I haven't had a normal life. And I never
felt like I was missing out on anything.

00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:39.697
But it feels like now it's my turn
to have some of the regular stuff.

00:20:40.615 --> 00:20:43.284
If you wanted to get married,
why didn't you say something before?

00:20:43.493 --> 00:20:45.411
Because I didn't know
how much I wanted it.

00:20:45.578 --> 00:20:48.581
And I love you,
and I wanted to live with you.

00:20:48.748 --> 00:20:50.708
I wanna live with you too.
I mean, let's do that.

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:53.002
But I don't think I can.

00:20:53.169 --> 00:20:57.090
It was okay to move in when
I didn't know what was gonna happen.

00:20:57.257 --> 00:21:00.802
But I can't move in knowing nothing
is ever gonna happen.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:04.722
Can we at least try living together? You
might change your mind about marriage.

00:21:05.723 --> 00:21:07.267
Are you gonna change yours?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.311
No.

00:21:11.562 --> 00:21:13.189
Me neither.

00:21:16.859 --> 00:21:22.115
Um, I think I need to be with someone
who wants what I want.

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.120
But I don't want this to end.

00:21:27.412 --> 00:21:29.706
No, I don't want it to end either.

00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:35.712
I can't believe this is gonna end.

00:21:39.007 --> 00:21:41.342
I guess I'll have my stuff picked up.

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.262
Yeah. Okay.

00:21:47.598 --> 00:21:50.059
Okay, so, uh...

00:22:03.823 --> 00:22:05.408
Good bye.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.705
- Take it easy, Mike.
- Bye, Mike. See you later, Mike.

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:16.461
I'm so sorry, Pheebs.

00:22:16.627 --> 00:22:18.796
We're all sorry.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.760
Look on the bright side.

00:22:23.926 --> 00:22:27.347
I mean, at least you
won't have to live with this ugly chair.

00:22:28.056 --> 00:22:30.433
That was here already, huh?

00:22:31.142 --> 00:22:32.852
I love you.

00:22:45.573 --> 00:22:48.117
I did it! I did it! Ha, ha!

00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:50.244
All right.

00:22:55.375 --> 00:22:57.877
I'd better take all I can carry.

00:22:59.379 --> 00:23:02.298
Who knows when I'll be able
to get in here again, huh?
