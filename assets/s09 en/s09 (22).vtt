WEBVTT

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.797
Oh, that feels so good.

00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:10.843
Oh, lucky me.
Coffee and a live sex show.

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:12.720
- I'm sorry, what?
- I'm sorry.

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:16.473
- Nothing. I was just reading to Emma.
- From Cosmo?

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:21.020
Yeah. Yeah, it's, uh:

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.189
"Climax Your Way to Better Skin."

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:28.485
So I have to go shopping today,
which is my least favorite thing.

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:30.821
I'm so bad at picking out clothes.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.159
So you need someone who knows
fashion to, uh, tell you what looks good.

00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:37.369
Not me. Not me. Not me.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:40.289
- Oh, hey, Rach?
- Yeah?

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:44.168
- Maybe you could take Charlie shopping?
- Oh, well...

00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:46.754
- I'm sure you have better things to do.
- You kidding?

00:00:46.921 --> 00:00:49.631
Rachel loves to shop,
and she has great taste.

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:53.052
She's the one that taught me not
to wear white after Labor Day...

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.723
...and to always, always, always put
on underwear when trying on clothes.

00:00:59.517 --> 00:01:02.227
If you have the time,
I'd really appreciate the help.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:04.646
Okay. Yeah, let's shop.

00:01:04.814 --> 00:01:09.401
Okay, you are gonna come back
with some very classy clothes. Ha-ha-ha.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:11.820
And some slutty lingerie. Slutty!

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:16.575
Okay, great. All right, bye.

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:18.827
Pain in the ass!

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:22.748
- That's off, right?
- What's the matter, Pheebs?

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:27.044
Ugh, Mike's sister just invited me to
a party tonight and he's gonna be there.

00:01:27.212 --> 00:01:31.757
She was like, "Don't worry. I asked him
and he's totally okay with seeing you."

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.761
So now I have to go so he'll think
that I'm totally okay with seeing him.

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.764
- You're not. You're hung up on him.
- Exactly.

00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:42.351
You want him to eat his heart out,
so you have to look fabulous.

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:44.728
I didn't even think about that.

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:47.689
Ugh. Sexual politics!

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.026
Pheebs, I'm taking Charlie shopping.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:54.404
- Come and I'll help you find something.
- That'd be great.

00:01:54.572 --> 00:02:00.119
Oh, isn't that nice? The three of you,
trying on slutty lingerie together.

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.499
- That's not what we're gonna do.
- Why'd you ruin it? Who was I hurting?

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:51.920
Wow.
Fortunately, she has a very pretty face.

00:02:55.925 --> 00:03:01.680
I still can't believe this.
My uterus is an inhospitable environment?

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.892
I've always tried so hard
to be a good hostess.

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.895
I can't believe my sperm
have low motility.

00:03:08.062 --> 00:03:12.733
While I was growing up, they sure
seemed to be in a hurry to get places.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.610
- Hi there.
- Hi.

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:17.863
I'm sorry there wasn't better news
from your tests last week...

00:03:18.031 --> 00:03:20.782
...but I wanted to talk to you
about your options.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.992
Okay.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.246
Even though your chances of conceiving
through natural means aren't great...

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:29.124
...you never know,
so keep having sex on a regular basis.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:31.335
Oh, damn it!

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:36.632
Don't worry.
After a while, you'll tune it out.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.136
Given your situation, the options
with the greatest chances for success...

00:03:41.304 --> 00:03:45.390
...would be surrogacy
or insemination using a sperm donor.

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.310
Okay.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:52.773
If you feel that neither of those is
right for you, you could always adopt.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.608
Is that a hint?

00:03:54.776 --> 00:04:00.447
Because we love you, Dr. Connelly,
but we don't want you to be our child.

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:07.746
Wow. Talk about
an inhospitable environment.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.377
Hi. Okay, you ready to go pick up
Phoebe and go shopping?

00:04:13.544 --> 00:04:16.630
- Let's do it.
- All right, have a good time.

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:19.383
Not gonna find any clothes in there.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:21.927
- Hey, you guys.
- Hi.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:26.431
Guess who's up for keynote speaker
at the National Paleontology Conference?

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.934
- Uh, Chris Bailey?
- Yeah, right.

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:32.562
When was the last time he made
a submission deadline for an abstract?

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.944
Why are you laughing?

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:42.739
Just seeing what it'd be like
to be a paleontologist.

00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:44.533
It's fun. Yeah.

00:04:45.702 --> 00:04:47.369
- You're up for keynote speaker?
- Yeah.

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:49.329
- Who's deciding?
- Professor Sherman.

00:04:49.497 --> 00:04:52.666
- I'm meeting with him today.
- He's a pretty tough guy to impress.

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:55.294
I think I know how to dazzle him.

00:04:55.461 --> 00:04:59.423
Oh, you're not gonna to do
a magic trick, are you?

00:04:59.674 --> 00:05:01.133
Pfft. No.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.686
- Hey, guys.
- I want to ask you something.

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:16.064
I may get to speak
at this paleontology convention.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:19.693
If I do, I'd love for you guys
to come and hear me.

00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:24.948
I think I can safely say that we all have
family issues, work and/or are sick.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.493
- It's in Barbados.
- But you come first.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.162
I'm there.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.414
- We'll see you guys.
- Bye.

00:05:32.582 --> 00:05:35.459
- See you.
- Hey.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:39.963
- So how did it go at the fertility clinic?
- Not as much fun as last time.

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:43.592
Apparently, you only get porn
if you're giving a sperm sample.

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.303
So, uh, what did the doctor say?

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:50.182
There's surrogacy, but Monica's dreamt
her whole life of carrying a child...

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.269
...and she just felt that watching
a surrogate would be too hard for her.

00:05:54.437 --> 00:05:56.646
- So you're ruling out surrogacy?
- Yeah.

00:05:56.814 --> 00:05:58.815
So I don't have to learn
what that means?

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:03.070
Aside from adoption, the only
other choice is insemination...

00:06:03.237 --> 00:06:05.280
...so we're talking about sperm donors.

00:06:05.448 --> 00:06:09.159
Enough said. I'm there for you, man.
Where is she, upstairs?

00:06:11.579 --> 00:06:13.205
How do you feel about all this?

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:18.377
I wish there was an easier way for us
to have a child, but there isn't one.

00:06:18.753 --> 00:06:22.339
Come on, Ross, be a good guy.
Step up and do it.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.508
What?

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:30.013
What? No!
I'm not gonna give them Ben!

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:39.272
The data we're receiving
from MRI scans and DNA testing...

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.483
...of these fossils are staggering.

00:06:41.692 --> 00:06:42.734
Mm-hm.

00:06:42.902 --> 00:06:46.071
I mean, we've been accepting
Leakey's dates as a given.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:49.324
But if they're off
by even a 100,000 years or so...

00:06:49.492 --> 00:06:53.328
...then you can just throw
most of our assumptions...

00:06:53.496 --> 00:06:55.789
...you know, right in the trash.

00:06:55.957 --> 00:07:00.043
So, what I'm saying is...

00:07:00.294 --> 00:07:02.045
Is that...

00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:07.050
Is that, uh, repercussions could be huge.

00:07:07.218 --> 00:07:10.971
I mean, not just in paleontology,
but if you think about it...

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:15.350
...in evolutionary biology,
uh genetics, uh, geology.

00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:18.145
I mean, truly, the mind boggles.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.651
Well, that's not what you want.

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:32.200
- Incentive for Men?
- I'll take some of that.

00:07:32.368 --> 00:07:34.035
- That's for men.
- I know.

00:07:34.203 --> 00:07:35.829
When I go to the party later...

00:07:35.997 --> 00:07:40.000
...Mike will know I'm over him
because I'll smell like another guy.

00:07:40.626 --> 00:07:42.127
Yeah.

00:07:42.295 --> 00:07:43.336
Okay.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.007
Oh, good, I'm dating
a Russian cabdriver.

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:51.428
Seriously, does anyone buy this?
I smell like beets.

00:07:53.639 --> 00:07:58.018
I really like those jackets with the
shoulder pads in them. Where are those?

00:07:58.186 --> 00:08:01.396
Um, on Melanie Griffith in Working Girl.

00:08:02.607 --> 00:08:05.275
Um, I think what you want is over here.

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.278
See, I told you I needed someone.

00:08:08.446 --> 00:08:11.823
By the way, as a thank you,
I would really love to take you out.

00:08:11.991 --> 00:08:15.243
- Really?
- Joey and I are going to a movie tonight.

00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:17.662
- You want to come?
- Oh, I can't.

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.832
Because I've seen them.

00:08:23.085 --> 00:08:25.545
You've seen all the movies?

00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:29.007
Yeah. I'm a big fan.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.634
Of the movies.

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:32.928
You know, motion pictures.

00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:34.471
The talkies.

00:08:36.474 --> 00:08:38.892
Rach, will you come with me
to a dressing room?

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.101
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.187
Maybe we could do something else.

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:46.816
You know, that depends on what it is.
I've done a lot of stuff.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:58.954
So, what were you doing out there?
Do you not like Charlie?

00:08:59.121 --> 00:09:03.083
She's okay. I don't know, I just don't
get a really good vibe from her.

00:09:03.251 --> 00:09:05.585
- Why?
- I don't know.

00:09:05.753 --> 00:09:10.882
You know, just the way
she waltzed in here all smart...

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:12.717
...and tall, you know...

00:09:12.885 --> 00:09:16.388
...and just swept Joey off his feet.
Nobody else has a chance.

00:09:16.889 --> 00:09:17.931
Who else?

00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:19.808
Anybody.

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:21.935
You.

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:23.770
Me.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.273
You know, Monica's mom.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:31.236
- You like Joey?
- Shh! Phoebe!

00:09:31.404 --> 00:09:35.865
All right, look, I do.
I have a little thing for him. Just...

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:38.660
- Oh, my God.
- It's just physical.

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:43.290
I have it totally under control, okay?
It's just when I see them together...

00:09:43.457 --> 00:09:46.626
...sometimes, I just get a little jealous.

00:09:46.794 --> 00:09:50.463
Wow. Isn't that ironic
that he liked you, and now you like...?

00:09:50.631 --> 00:09:52.132
I get it!

00:09:53.384 --> 00:09:55.552
All right, as long as it's under control.

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.763
You can't do anything about it.
He's already dating her.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:00.974
She is a nice person.
That wouldn't be right.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:04.102
I know, I know.
So it's just not a big deal.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.521
- So can we keep this between us?
- Sure.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:10.817
Great, because I gotta get out of here.
The smell of beets is killing me.

00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:19.909
- Any chance Charlie has a deaf twin?
- Mm.

00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.416
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

00:10:26.584 --> 00:10:29.669
I brought a friend home for dinner.
This is Zack from work.

00:10:29.837 --> 00:10:33.131
Oh, of course. It's so nice
to see you again, Zack.

00:10:33.299 --> 00:10:35.967
- You too.
- You guys haven't actually met before.

00:10:36.135 --> 00:10:38.011
But, boy, you're both polite.

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:40.180
Have a seat. I'll get you a beer.

00:10:40.348 --> 00:10:42.515
- I got it.
- Thanks.

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:48.938
- So Zack's pretty nice, huh?
- Yeah, I guess.

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:53.276
So how would you like to have a baby
that's half yours and half his?

00:10:57.239 --> 00:10:58.281
Excuse me?

00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:01.910
We're talking about sperm donors,
and Zack may be the guy.

00:11:02.078 --> 00:11:07.123
Look. He's intelligent, he's healthy,
he's athletic. I mean, he's sperm-tastic!

00:11:09.251 --> 00:11:13.046
Chandler, this is crazy.
Well, what did you even say to him?

00:11:13.214 --> 00:11:16.508
"Come up. Meet my wife.
Give us your sperm."

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:20.387
I invited him to dinner so you'd get
a chance to get to know him.

00:11:20.554 --> 00:11:23.807
With a sperm bank, you never
meet the guy, get to check him out.

00:11:23.974 --> 00:11:26.393
- Chandler!
- I'm telling you, he's great.

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.730
I mean, even if my sperm worked fine,
I think he'd be the way to go.

00:11:32.149 --> 00:11:34.192
I'm not going to be a part of this.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:38.697
You can't bring some random guy home
and expect him to be our sperm donor.

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:39.906
Okay.

00:11:41.909 --> 00:11:43.576
- Zack?
- Thanks.

00:11:44.203 --> 00:11:47.122
Do you have a coaster?
I don't want to make a ring.

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:49.457
Tell me about yourself, Zack.

00:11:54.088 --> 00:11:57.674
Oh, God, do you think she heard?
It'd be so bad if she heard.

00:11:57.842 --> 00:12:01.928
Maybe she didn't hear. I'll go into that
dressing room and talk. You stay here.

00:12:02.096 --> 00:12:04.055
- See if you can hear me.
- Okay, great.

00:12:06.976 --> 00:12:10.270
Oh, thank God,
I can't hear a word that you're saying.

00:12:10.438 --> 00:12:15.066
- I didn't say anything yet.
- Well, get back in there and talk.

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:17.444
I'm Rachel.

00:12:17.611 --> 00:12:21.406
It's so annoying when I put Emma
on the phone to talk with my friends.

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:22.866
What?

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:26.494
Well, some things are just hard
to say to your face.

00:12:27.955 --> 00:12:32.000
Okay, well, I heard that.
Which means that she heard it too.

00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:36.129
- We have a problem.
- Oh, what are we gonna do?

00:12:36.297 --> 00:12:38.131
Just be honest with her.

00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:40.091
Oh, my God!

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:42.594
It is annoying when parents
put babies on the phone.

00:12:42.762 --> 00:12:44.763
All right, enough out of you!

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:55.315
- Hello?
- I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?

00:12:55.483 --> 00:12:58.318
No, she, uh, went shopping with Rachel.
Why? What's up?

00:12:58.486 --> 00:13:02.447
I'm meeting with Professor Sherman
about my being the keynote speaker.

00:13:02.615 --> 00:13:04.991
- How's it going?
- It could be better.

00:13:06.368 --> 00:13:09.287
He, um... He fell asleep.

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:12.457
What? But I already bought
my ticket to Bermuda!

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:16.669
- Barbados.
- Fine, I'll rent a car and drive.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:19.964
You have to get that job.

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.425
What am I supposed to do?
He's out cold.

00:13:22.593 --> 00:13:25.303
In fact, he was just talking
in his sleep before...

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:29.849
...and evidently he wants someone
named Fran to "spank him harder."

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:33.311
- Well, just wake him up.
- I can't.

00:13:33.479 --> 00:13:37.857
If he realizes that I'm the one who
put him to sleep, I won't get the job.

00:13:38.025 --> 00:13:39.526
Ooh, that's a tough one.

00:13:39.693 --> 00:13:42.612
Oh, wait a minute.
This happened to me before.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:48.034
Yeah, I was auditioning for a play,
and the producer fell asleep. I...

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:50.328
No, wait a minute.

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.080
It was me who fell asleep.

00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:57.126
I mean, hey, Shakespeare, how about
a chase scene once in a while?

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:03.800
- Hey, guys, dinner's ready.
- I'm gonna go wash up first.

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:05.009
Thanks.

00:14:08.097 --> 00:14:12.851
What do you think? I want his genes for
my kid. Those eyes, those cheekbones.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.604
Okay, there's enthusiastic,
and there's just plain gay.

00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:20.900
- You don't like him.
- I think he's fine.

00:14:21.068 --> 00:14:23.319
But we don't know
anything real about him.

00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:27.824
- I wish we could get more information.
- All right, just follow my lead.

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:32.161
- You guys have a great place here.
- Thanks. I'm crazy about our place.

00:14:32.329 --> 00:14:34.122
Hey, speaking of crazy...

00:14:35.749 --> 00:14:39.252
...do you have a history
of mental illness in the family?

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:44.799
Uh, no. Although, I did have an uncle
who voted for Dukakis.

00:14:45.384 --> 00:14:48.386
That's really not the kind of thing
we're looking for.

00:14:50.014 --> 00:14:51.055
Okay.

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:55.268
So, um, tell me, how'd you guys meet?

00:14:55.436 --> 00:14:58.730
Oh, friends first, drunk in London,
you know the story.

00:14:58.898 --> 00:15:00.607
I've got a better question for you:

00:15:01.108 --> 00:15:04.319
Do you or any of your blood relatives
have diabetes?

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:07.780
No.

00:15:08.198 --> 00:15:11.784
Uh, heart disease? Alzheimer's? Gout?

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.831
You guys don't have people
for dinner a lot, huh?

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.375
We're just making conversation.

00:15:19.543 --> 00:15:23.004
Yeah, well, okay.
I heard a joke today. It's pretty funny.

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:25.924
You know what's not funny?
Male pattern baldness.

00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:33.306
You guys have shown a lot of interest
in me tonight, and I'm flattered...

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:35.767
...and quite frankly, a little frightened.

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:38.227
Can we just talk about something else?

00:15:38.395 --> 00:15:39.812
- Sure.
- All right.

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:41.856
This ravioli's delicious.

00:15:42.066 --> 00:15:46.277
I notice you're enjoying that ravioli
with a beautiful set of teeth.

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:48.321
Did you have braces as a child?

00:15:48.572 --> 00:15:50.949
- No, I didn't.
- Yes!

00:15:53.994 --> 00:15:56.496
We're teeth people, Zack.

00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:05.004
Let's just do it. Let's just go
over there and see if she heard.

00:16:05.172 --> 00:16:06.297
- Good plan.
- Okay.

00:16:07.341 --> 00:16:11.010
- What? Where are you going?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Rachel.

00:16:11.178 --> 00:16:14.514
I don't have time
for your childish games, okay?

00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:17.266
I still have to find something
incredible to wear...

00:16:17.434 --> 00:16:20.436
...so I can beat Mike
at "Who's More Over Who"!

00:16:25.442 --> 00:16:26.943
- Hey. Hi.
- Hey.

00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:29.570
- Where have you been?
- Trying on clothes.

00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:34.575
Oh, really? In the dressing room?
Well, that's so weird.

00:16:34.743 --> 00:16:39.998
Phoebe and I were in the dressing room.
Gosh, it's just such a small world.

00:16:40.165 --> 00:16:42.709
Rachel, I heard you
two guys whispering.

00:16:42.876 --> 00:16:46.004
Oh, God, you did, you heard.
Okay, look, let me explain.

00:16:46.171 --> 00:16:48.172
There's nothing to explain.
I heard you.

00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:49.674
Phoebe likes Joey.

00:16:54.638 --> 00:16:55.680
Yeah.

00:16:57.766 --> 00:17:00.560
I don't understand it.
I mean, Phoebe likes Joey...

00:17:00.728 --> 00:17:03.688
...and then she's here to buy a dress
to impress another guy?

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:08.651
Yeah, that's Phoebe. That's Phoebe.
You know, she just wants them all.

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.696
It's, like, she's nympho.

00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.532
- Wow!
- Yeah.

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.536
You know, by the way, I heard you
tell her not to do anything.

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:23.041
Thanks for sticking up for me.
God, you are such a nice person.

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.418
I try.

00:17:59.036 --> 00:18:00.745
Oh!

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:08.503
Oh, my God, you really want me
to be the keynote speaker?

00:18:09.338 --> 00:18:11.130
Thank you!

00:18:13.383 --> 00:18:15.093
You're welcome.

00:18:27.773 --> 00:18:29.774
Wow! You look...

00:18:30.692 --> 00:18:32.944
...stop-eating hot!

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.240
Which is like the highest level
of hotness.

00:18:37.407 --> 00:18:41.744
Okay, are you sure? Because I am
really dreading going to this party.

00:18:41.912 --> 00:18:42.954
Then don't go.

00:18:43.122 --> 00:18:46.874
Mike knows I'm coming. If I don't show
up, he'll think it's because of him...

00:18:47.042 --> 00:18:51.838
...and then I'm gonna lose face.
That's a very serious thing in my culture.

00:18:52.881 --> 00:18:57.468
All right, then you go to that party,
and you pretend to be over Mike.

00:18:57.636 --> 00:19:01.180
Afterward, you come to my place
and I'll get you good and drunk.

00:19:01.348 --> 00:19:03.099
You got it. Okay.

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.810
But not on the wine
that you made, okay?

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:09.897
Because I just don't want to go back
to the emergency room.

00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:20.950
David?

00:19:21.118 --> 00:19:22.702
Phoebe! Hi.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.288
- Oh, my God!
- Hi.

00:19:25.956 --> 00:19:28.291
Wow! You look unbelievable.

00:19:28.458 --> 00:19:30.209
Oh, yeah, well...

00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:33.838
What are you doing here?

00:19:34.006 --> 00:19:36.966
Well, I'm back from Minsk.
Uh, permanently.

00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:38.342
Well, what happened?

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.344
Remember how I was trying
to achieve...

00:19:40.512 --> 00:19:43.389
...the positronic distillation
of subatomic particles?

00:19:43.557 --> 00:19:45.016
Yeah.

00:19:45.184 --> 00:19:48.728
Well, after eight years of research,
I discovered...

00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:51.397
...that it can't be done.

00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:53.274
Well...

00:19:54.067 --> 00:19:56.777
...great that you're back. How are you?

00:19:56.945 --> 00:19:58.821
- Good. Good. Life is good.
- Good.

00:19:58.989 --> 00:20:02.825
- Well, I'm seeing someone.
- Oh.

00:20:03.076 --> 00:20:04.577
- Good for you.
- Yeah.

00:20:04.745 --> 00:20:09.123
She's also a scientist,
so she's very smart and pretty and, um...

00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:11.751
It's actually because of you
that we're together.

00:20:11.919 --> 00:20:14.795
I mean, I saw what you had
with that Mike guy...

00:20:14.963 --> 00:20:17.048
...and I just said, "Boy, I want that."

00:20:17.674 --> 00:20:20.551
- Mike and I broke up.
- You're kidding me.

00:20:20.719 --> 00:20:24.847
Because I'm not seeing anybody.
I just totally made that up.

00:20:25.015 --> 00:20:27.058
- Really?
- I don't know why, I'm sorry.

00:20:27.226 --> 00:20:29.852
I guess I just didn't want
to lose face.

00:20:30.145 --> 00:20:32.271
I understand.

00:20:32.689 --> 00:20:35.858
Yeah. Okay. So then, okay...

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:39.946
So we're both living in New York,
not seeing anyone.

00:20:40.113 --> 00:20:42.365
- That's so not like us.
- Yeah, I know.

00:20:42.532 --> 00:20:47.078
Well, this is probably a stupid question,
seeing that you look like that...

00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:50.122
...but, um, do you have someplace
that you need to be right now?

00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:51.332
Well...

00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:53.668
No.

00:20:55.545 --> 00:20:58.589
- Well, do you want to get a drink?
- I'd love to.

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.716
- Great.
- Okay.

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:05.721
Uh, do you smell beets?

00:21:05.889 --> 00:21:08.641
Oh, all right, stay upwind of me.

00:21:10.852 --> 00:21:14.605
Hey, there's Phoebe.
Is that Mike she's with?

00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:17.316
No, that's David.

00:21:17.484 --> 00:21:20.236
There's a third guy?

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:23.906
Tip of the iceberg.

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:28.202
I'm gonna take off now.

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.913
You're gonna let me go home,
aren't you?

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:33.457
Sure you don't want to stay
a little longer?

00:21:33.625 --> 00:21:35.751
No, I should get home.
I'm kind of tired.

00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:37.628
Are you always tired?

00:21:37.796 --> 00:21:40.673
Because that could be
a sign of clinical depression.

00:21:41.341 --> 00:21:45.136
No, it's tiring to figure out the age
at which all my grandparents died.

00:21:47.097 --> 00:21:49.098
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

00:21:49.266 --> 00:21:50.308
Bye.

00:21:51.768 --> 00:21:53.936
I think we found our sperm.

00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:56.480
He does seem pretty perfect.

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:59.025
Yeah? You think so?
Should I ask him?

00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:02.737
No.

00:22:02.904 --> 00:22:05.531
Why not? Just because his
great-grandmother was obese?

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:08.367
Our kid's gonna get that
from you anyway.

00:22:10.662 --> 00:22:12.705
No, that's not it.

00:22:12.873 --> 00:22:17.335
It's just that when we were asking him
all those questions before...

00:22:17.502 --> 00:22:22.423
...I just realized I don't care if he
is the most perfect guy in the world.

00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:26.260
- He's not you.
- Yeah, he's better!

00:22:27.888 --> 00:22:30.097
No, he's not.

00:22:30.265 --> 00:22:34.602
If I can't get pregnant with you,
then I don't want to get pregnant by him...

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:36.354
...or anyone else.

00:22:37.731 --> 00:22:41.233
- Really? Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:43.819
Thank God, because I
don't wanna do this either.

00:22:43.987 --> 00:22:47.198
I was just doing it because I thought
that was what you wanted.

00:22:47.366 --> 00:22:50.951
I'm the husband.
I'm supposed to bring the sperm.

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:53.704
That is so sweet.

00:22:54.623 --> 00:22:55.956
I love you.

00:22:59.586 --> 00:23:01.712
So you know this leaves us with...

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:03.506
Adoption.

00:23:04.466 --> 00:23:06.217
How do you feel about that?

00:23:07.677 --> 00:23:10.304
I think I feel okay about it.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.141
Actually, I think I feel
really good about it.

00:23:15.268 --> 00:23:16.310
Me too.

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:21.232
I wanna find a baby that needs a home,
and I wanna raise it with you.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.111
And I wanna mess it up
in our own specific way.

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:30.157
So this is it?
We're really gonna adopt?

00:23:30.951 --> 00:23:31.992
Yeah.

00:23:32.702 --> 00:23:36.997
- Oh, my God! We're gonna be parents!
- We are gonna be great parents.

00:23:37.165 --> 00:23:38.416
And it could be soon.

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:41.752
I mean, think about it.
Right now, somewhere out there...

00:23:42.170 --> 00:23:44.588
...our baby could be being conceived.

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:49.301
Wait. If we're lucky,
and we're really, really, really quiet...

00:23:49.469 --> 00:23:53.139
...we may be able to hear
the sound of a condom breaking.

00:23:58.979 --> 00:24:00.062
Hey, Zack.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.398
Hey, Chandler.

00:24:02.566 --> 00:24:04.400
I wanted to apologize for last night.

00:24:04.568 --> 00:24:06.944
I got the feeling
we made you uncomfortable.

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.279
- No, you didn't.
- Really?

00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:10.156
No, you did.

00:24:10.323 --> 00:24:12.992
My wife and I have
some boundary issues.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.286
Sometimes we ask
inappropriate questions.

00:24:15.454 --> 00:24:17.037
We're working on it.

00:24:17.205 --> 00:24:20.541
- Here are the boards for Friday's pitch.
- Thank you.

00:24:22.794 --> 00:24:26.505
You wouldn't know if she's planning
on keeping her baby, would you?
