WEBVTT

00:00:03.044 --> 00:00:04.545
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:09.425
So, what's the big news you had us
rush all the way over here for?

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:13.470
Our news. My company has asked me
to head up our office in Tulsa.

00:00:13.638 --> 00:00:16.265
So as of Monday,
I'm being officially relocated.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.142
- Oh, my God!
- What? Monday?

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:21.645
- How long do you have to go for?
- They said it could be up to a year.

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:24.148
- A year?
- Well, do you have to go?

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.777
Well, I kind of have to, don't I?

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:31.321
Because of this stupid thing.

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.370
There's nothing like the support
of your loving wife, huh?

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.956
Wait a minute.
Wait, you can't go to Tulsa.

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:44.835
Maybe you forgot, but we have tickets
to the Jets game next week!

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.921
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'll be able to make it.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:51.300
But we were gonna go see the Jets!

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:57.473
You can't go. I mean, you're the glue
that holds this group together.

00:00:57.974 --> 00:01:00.434
- Really?
- Not you.

00:01:03.855 --> 00:01:06.023
I can't believe you guys are moving.

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:11.070
- I call their apartment!
- No!

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.072
No!

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:51.777
Here you go, Rach.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.070
- Oh, thank you, Joey.
- Yeah.

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:56.532
Oh, you know what?
I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:02:00.244
I went through this with Ben and Carol.
One coffee won't affect your milk.

00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:02.955
Yeah, just to be sure,
I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:10.629
- Every time?
- Mm-hm.

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:14.591
You don't have to call him
whenever you have a question, okay?

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:18.929
- Trust me. I know this.
- All right. I trust you.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:22.599
I can see you dialing.
I don't understand why...

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.476
Shh, I'm on the phone! Dr. Wiener?

00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:31.984
It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel
with a baby. It's just so grown-up.

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:36.405
I know, yeah.
I feel like we're all growing up.

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.366
A person named "Wiener."
God, that kills me.

00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:42.452
- Look at you all grown-up.
- Yeah.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.538
Well, actually, you know what?

00:02:45.123 --> 00:02:46.582
I am, you know?

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.960
Well, that whole thing
with Rachel made me realize...

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:53.422
...that maybe I'm ready for a more
serious relationship, you know?

00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:57.134
Like, I'd like to meet a nice,
mature, commitment-minded lady.

00:02:57.302 --> 00:02:59.970
And looks aren't as important as...

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:02.306
- Nah, she's gotta be hot.
Mm-hm

00:03:03.391 --> 00:03:05.392
You know, I might know somebody.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.270
How about you set me up
with someone, and we double-date?

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.772
I can do that. Yeah.
How's, uh, Friday?

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:12.024
- Done!
- All right.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.233
- Oh, good, really?
- Yeah.

00:03:13.401 --> 00:03:15.068
Okay, let's see. Hee, hee.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.237
All right.

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:20.532
Um, oh, you know who's great?
Sandy Poopack.

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.786
"Poopack"? Ha-ha-ha.

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.249
Yeah. All right.
Well, that rules out Lana Titwyler.

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.380
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.967
- I've got good news.
- You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:40.761
Okay, I have news.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.391
You don't have to move to Tulsa.
You can stay here and keep your job.

00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:47.976
That's great! How?

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:51.521
My boss and I worked out a deal
where I'm in Tulsa four days a week.

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:53.899
So the other three,
I can be here with you.

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:57.277
So you're gonna be gone
four days a week?

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.821
No.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:03.283
I'm sorry, are you just
used to saying that?

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.747
No. I can't be away
from you for that long.

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.124
- Really?
- Yeah, you're my husband.

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:15.587
I won't live in a different state
than you for 208 days out of the year.

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:20.884
That's fast math.
We could use you in Tulsa.

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:26.890
Thanks for trying to figure out a way,
but if you go to Tulsa, I go with you.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.684
Ha-ha-ha. Hey.

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.185
You said that without gagging.

00:04:30.895 --> 00:04:32.354
I know!

00:04:35.733 --> 00:04:37.442
Well, excuse me?

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.196
Oh, yeah?
Well, up yours too!

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:45.659
- Who the hell was that?
- Dr. Wiener.

00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:51.248
Rach, you can't call people
at 3 in the morning.

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.500
You know what?
You sound just like his wife.

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:56.962
Was there anything
even wrong with Emma?

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.383
Yes, of course there is!
Okay? I'm not insane.

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.093
What was it?

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:05.887
Hiccups.

00:05:06.097 --> 00:05:10.392
I told you, you can't call him
every time any little thing comes up.

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:14.646
Well, not anymore I can't.
He fired us!

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:19.318
What are we gonna do?
We have to find a pediatrician.

00:05:19.527 --> 00:05:22.362
Wait, wait, wait. Monica said that
when you guys were growing up...

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.573
...you liked your doctor.
What was his name?

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:26.825
Dr. Gettleman?

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.828
Uh, yeah, no, I don't think
that's a good idea.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:32.247
- In fact, I think... I think he's dead.
- Ugh!

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:34.458
Why does everything happen to me?

00:05:35.918 --> 00:05:39.046
I promise, first thing tomorrow,
we'll find another doctor.

00:05:39.213 --> 00:05:41.673
But I gotta get up early,
and I'm not feeling well.

00:05:41.883 --> 00:05:44.634
You're not feeling well?
What do you have? Rubella?

00:05:44.802 --> 00:05:47.804
Because don't go near Emma,
she has not had that shot.

00:05:48.473 --> 00:05:52.225
You know, come to think of it,
it does feel rubella-like.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:05.072
Wiener!

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:07.240
Wiener! Wiener! Wiener!

00:06:07.408 --> 00:06:08.450
Rachel!

00:06:08.993 --> 00:06:11.745
Great! Now he's gonna
know it was me!

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:18.377
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:21.546
So how is this
for our big double date tonight?

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:24.966
Oh, my God.

00:06:25.468 --> 00:06:28.428
Ooh. Great. Just the reaction
I was hoping for.

00:06:29.305 --> 00:06:33.558
Yeah, so you, uh, found someone
for me? You didn't forget?

00:06:33.768 --> 00:06:36.144
Of course not.
And you'll love Mary Ellen.

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.898
She's really smart and cute
and funny and...

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:43.568
I can't tell you how I know this,
but she is not opposed to threesomes.

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:47.697
- All right.
- Yeah.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.536
- So tell me something about my guy.
- No.

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:57.040
Come on, give me something.
What's his name?

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:00.919
- Mike. Yeah.
- Mike. Okay, what's his last name?

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:03.713
Damn it! Is there no mystery left
in romance anymore?!

00:07:05.466 --> 00:07:08.593
We'll see you and Mike
at the restaurant in a couple hours.

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:09.803
All right, great.

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.889
- All right, bye. Yeah.
- See you. Bye-bye.

00:07:13.057 --> 00:07:17.102
Why'd I have to say Mike? I don't know
a Mike! Why couldn't I have said?

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:21.189
There's no guys in there!

00:07:24.652 --> 00:07:26.820
Ugh, it's impossible
to find a good doctor.

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.697
How do you know the good ones...

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:32.492
...from the ones who'll push
their penis against your knee?

00:07:33.744 --> 00:07:34.953
Excuse me?

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.289
I know what she's talking about.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.921
Well, we've gotta find
a new pediatrician.

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:48.133
Ross was getting sick last night,
and Emma may have caught it.

00:07:48.342 --> 00:07:51.178
- Why don't you see Dr. Gettleman?
- Ross said he died.

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:54.264
He didn't die.
I just saw his daughter last week.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:59.269
She said he was fine.
Her, on the other hand, botched Botox.

00:08:00.354 --> 00:08:02.898
Oh, great. Well then,
I'm gonna take Emma to see him.

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:04.858
I wonder why Ross said that he died?

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:07.944
Oh, maybe he confused him
with his childhood therapist.

00:08:08.112 --> 00:08:09.237
He saw a therapist?

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:12.365
Mm-hm. He used to have
a recurring nightmare. It freaked him out.

00:08:12.575 --> 00:08:14.242
Wow, what was it?

00:08:14.785 --> 00:08:16.453
That I was going to eat him.

00:08:30.718 --> 00:08:32.719
Mike!

00:08:34.096 --> 00:08:35.388
Yeah?

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.477
Okay.

00:08:44.565 --> 00:08:46.900
I can't believe
I'm doing this with you.

00:08:47.109 --> 00:08:49.569
Although I did just end
a nine-year relationship...

00:08:49.737 --> 00:08:51.821
...so I should be open
to taking some risks.

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:55.867
It'll be fine. Follow my lead, okay? All you
have to do is pretend to be Mike.

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:57.953
- I am Mike.
- Attaboy.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.624
Here they come.

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:04.251
- Hi, I'm Phoebe.
- Hey, Phoebe.

00:09:04.418 --> 00:09:06.002
- I'm Mike.
- Nice to meet you.

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.171
Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins.

00:09:08.381 --> 00:09:11.841
So, Mike, how do you and Joey
know each other, anyway?

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:17.222
Uh, how do Joey and I
know each other?

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:20.183
Wow, if I had a nickel for every time
somebody's asked me that.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.896
- From school.
- We met in college.

00:09:27.567 --> 00:09:29.234
I mean high school.

00:09:31.362 --> 00:09:35.657
You guys go way back, then.
So, what are you up to these days?

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:39.619
- Well, I'm a lawyer.
- Mike, attorney at law! Ha, ha.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.831
- Actually, I just gave up my practice.
- What?

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.376
That's the kind of thing
you usually run by me. Ha, ha.

00:09:47.587 --> 00:09:51.881
I want to play piano professionally.
If I don't do this now, I never will.

00:09:52.091 --> 00:09:54.384
Great. I like that better
than the lawyer thing.

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:58.555
Which is why I waited until now
to introduce you to Mike. Ha, ha.

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:00.682
You thought he was still a lawyer.

00:10:00.891 --> 00:10:04.060
No, that's not what I meant.
Let's get you a cocktail.

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:08.648
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:09.858
What are you doing?

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:12.652
Looking for restaurant jobs
for you in Tulsa.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.863
Aw, that's so sweet.
Did you find anything?

00:10:15.031 --> 00:10:17.782
- Slim Pickins.
- Hmm. Nothing, huh?

00:10:17.992 --> 00:10:21.453
No. Slim Pickins.
It's a barbecue joint.

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:25.749
They're looking for a cook. Actually,
"cook" may be a bit of a stretch.

00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:28.501
They're looking for somebody
to shovel mesquite.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:32.339
"Slim Pickins"? That is so cheesy.

00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:35.383
Well, So Cheesy also has an opening.

00:10:35.593 --> 00:10:37.969
Heh, honey, that's okay.
I know this woman, Nancy...

00:10:38.137 --> 00:10:41.598
...who's a restaurant biz headhunter.
She may know something.

00:10:41.766 --> 00:10:44.392
Can I say how much I appreciate
you coming with me?

00:10:44.602 --> 00:10:48.104
When we get to Tulsa, I am taking you
for a great dinner at Slim Pickins.

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:51.107
So Cheesy?

00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:54.986
Whole Hog?

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:59.407
It's gonna be tough
to keep kosher in Tulsa.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:06.790
Hi, Nancy?
Hi, it's Monica Geller.

00:11:06.957 --> 00:11:11.961
I'm good. Listen, I'm looking
for a job in Tulsa.

00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:16.049
Yeah, well, my husband's
been relocated. Ha, ha.

00:11:16.634 --> 00:11:18.802
Because I love him.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.971
No, I don't want a job in New York.

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:25.392
Javu's looking? Oh, my God!

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:29.521
He asked for me personally?
Oh, my God!

00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:33.233
Oh, uh, wow, this is really,
really flattering.

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:36.152
But, um, I'm moving to Tulsa.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.947
So, just, if you would tell Javu...

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:41.032
...I'll take it!

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:46.037
Hi. Um, my name's Rachel Green.
I have an appointment for Emma.

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:49.416
Dr. Gettleman is finishing up
with a patient. He'll be out shortly.

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:50.625
Okay, thank you.

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:53.795
I think you just have a cold.
It's definitely not strep.

00:11:54.004 --> 00:11:55.296
Thanks, doctor.

00:11:58.217 --> 00:12:01.761
- Would you like a lollipop?
- Do you even have to ask?

00:12:07.393 --> 00:12:09.519
He is alive!

00:12:15.526 --> 00:12:19.070
It's so surprising that you and Joey
have known each other for so long...

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:21.030
...and I've never heard about you.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.618
Oh, that's, uh, because we had
a bit of a falling out.

00:12:25.786 --> 00:12:28.788
Mike hit my mom with a car.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:35.211
- No, I didn't.
- That's okay. I have forgiven you.

00:12:35.379 --> 00:12:37.672
Now we're friends again,
and everything's great. Heh.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.507
Well, wait. Is your mom okay?

00:12:39.717 --> 00:12:43.178
Please, we're trying
to have a conversation.

00:12:44.722 --> 00:12:46.973
Wow, you're a lot nicer
on Days of Our Lives.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.684
Days of Our Lives!
That's why you look so familiar!

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:50.977
- What?
- What?

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.645
What?

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.191
Do you not know each other?

00:12:57.902 --> 00:13:03.406
Of course we do. He's playing a game
we used to play in high school.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.785
We pretend we don't know each other.
We played all kinds of games.

00:13:06.952 --> 00:13:10.747
You remember that one where I punch
you in the face for not being cool?

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:16.878
Let me ask you something:
How many sisters does Joey have?

00:13:17.087 --> 00:13:20.757
- Six.
- What are you doing? I said seven!

00:13:20.925 --> 00:13:22.634
Oh.

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:26.429
Joey, why did you set me up
with a stranger?

00:13:27.306 --> 00:13:31.351
Because I forgot about our date.
I'm so sorry.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.939
I'm sorry too. And just to be clear,
I didn't hit his mother with a car.

00:13:36.524 --> 00:13:41.236
You are unbelievable. I spent so much
time finding the perfect girl for you.

00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:44.405
Mary Ellen is really smart
and cute and loose.

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:46.074
Hey.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:48.368
Oh, who are you kidding?

00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:56.584
You find some guy
off the street for me?

00:13:56.752 --> 00:13:58.711
God, this is humiliating!

00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:03.258
I'm so sorry. If you don't like this guy,
I can find you a better one.

00:14:03.425 --> 00:14:05.510
- Mike? Mike?
- Oh.

00:14:06.971 --> 00:14:08.221
I'm out of here.

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:10.640
It was nice meeting you.

00:14:10.808 --> 00:14:14.018
- You're leaving too?
- I'll stay if you can tell me my name.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:15.436
- Have a good night.
- Mm-hm.

00:14:19.733 --> 00:14:22.402
We leave tomorrow,
and you still have a lot to pack.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.862
You're right.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:26.531
Maybe I shouldn't go.

00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:29.951
- What?
- Um.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:34.747
So Nancy told me about this job
at this great restaurant, Javu?

00:14:34.915 --> 00:14:37.000
But it's just
a little outside of Tulsa.

00:14:37.167 --> 00:14:38.501
Well, how far outside?

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:40.879
Manhattan?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.758
And, uh, you're thinking of taking it?

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:51.222
Before, you said that being with me
was more important than any job.

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:56.561
But I guess now it's, uh,
old job, me, new job.

00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.023
- I'm gonna miss this hand!
- Ha, ha.

00:15:02.192 --> 00:15:03.860
I know this is a lot to ask...

00:15:04.028 --> 00:15:07.030
...but, my God, this is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

00:15:07.197 --> 00:15:10.199
What happened to "you can't live
without me four days a week"?

00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:14.162
Well, if you really think about it,
I mean, four days is not that long.

00:15:15.664 --> 00:15:17.624
I see you Monday
before you go to work...

00:15:17.791 --> 00:15:19.542
...and Thursday when you get back...

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:23.212
...and I always work late on Tuesdays,
so really if you think about it, ha, ha...

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.797
...it's really just one day.

00:15:24.965 --> 00:15:30.011
Um, well, if we can't make it one day,
we got real problems, my friend.

00:15:34.141 --> 00:15:37.310
- I think you should take the job.
- Really?

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:41.606
I know it must be important to you
when you start chattering like a monkey.

00:15:43.651 --> 00:15:46.027
That's the nicest thing
anybody's ever said to me.

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.407
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:54.535
- How was the pediatrician?
- Oh, I really liked him.

00:15:54.703 --> 00:15:59.582
Yeah, yeah.
It was really, really, really good.

00:15:59.792 --> 00:16:02.877
- You promised not to say anything.
- I know.

00:16:03.337 --> 00:16:05.004
Ross still sees his pediatrician!

00:16:08.217 --> 00:16:09.884
I don't care.

00:16:11.428 --> 00:16:14.639
Are you serious?
You still see Dr. Gettleman?

00:16:14.848 --> 00:16:16.724
He is a brilliant diagnostician!

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:20.687
- Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?
- Mm.

00:16:21.397 --> 00:16:24.148
Seriously, you gotta go
to an appropriate doctor.

00:16:24.316 --> 00:16:28.403
Why? I know it's a little weird,
but, hey, he is a great doctor, okay?

00:16:28.570 --> 00:16:30.530
He knows my medical history.

00:16:30.698 --> 00:16:33.241
And every time I go in there,
he makes a big deal.

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:36.160
You know,
"Ah, look, it's my favorite patient."

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:39.998
Does he say that before he sticks
his thermometer in your tushy?

00:16:40.207 --> 00:16:44.836
I seem to remember someone bringing
his security blanket to college.

00:16:45.045 --> 00:16:47.880
That was not a security blanket.
That was a wall hanging.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.174
It didn't spend much time on the wall!

00:17:00.227 --> 00:17:02.186
Oh, excuse me, uh.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.441
Hi. I was hoping to run into you.
Uh, can we talk?

00:17:06.608 --> 00:17:07.817
Sure.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:11.779
I'm sorry, really.
I'm so embarrassed.

00:17:11.947 --> 00:17:13.281
Is it all right?

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:20.329
Really, I'm a pretty nice guy.
Just ask my parole officer.

00:17:23.375 --> 00:17:25.334
Apparently, I'm not a funny guy.

00:17:28.714 --> 00:17:31.841
Well, why did you go along with that?

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:37.138
Because I was told that I'd get
a free dinner, which I didn't.

00:17:37.306 --> 00:17:40.600
And that I'd meet a pretty girl,
which I did.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:44.854
That's true.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:50.860
Well, is anything you told me
about yourself true?

00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:53.196
My name is Mike.
And I do play piano.

00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:55.698
Oh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Prove it.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:57.992
There isn't a piano here.

00:17:58.202 --> 00:18:01.120
That wouldn't stand in the way
of a true pianist.

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:03.706
Okay.

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:21.891
You are really good.

00:18:24.937 --> 00:18:26.145
Uh, um.

00:18:26.313 --> 00:18:28.272
- I play a little guitar myself.
- Really?

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.816
- Uh-huh.
- That's great.

00:18:30.025 --> 00:18:33.611
- What kind of music do you play?
- Um, like acoustic, folksy stuff.

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:36.906
But right now I'm working on
a couple Iron Maiden covers.

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:45.915
Do you think that, maybe,
sometime, I could, uh...

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.501
It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.589
Okay. You think, maybe,
sometime I could take you out?

00:18:53.757 --> 00:18:56.509
Oh, you just caught me off guard, um.

00:18:57.553 --> 00:18:59.470
Yeah, that would be nice.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.265
Look at this! My two best friends!

00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:10.231
Excuse me, uh.
I don't mean to be a jerk...

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:13.985
...but the baby with the rash
came in after me.

00:19:14.862 --> 00:19:17.071
The doctor will be right with you, sir.

00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:23.619
Mommy, I can't find Waldo.

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:26.581
What, the circus?
He's behind the elephant.

00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:30.459
Wow. So your child's a big fan
of the Waldo books too?

00:19:32.796 --> 00:19:35.298
Yeah, that's how I know.

00:19:36.508 --> 00:19:38.551
- I'm Ross, by the way.
- Hi, I'm Sally.

00:19:38.719 --> 00:19:39.760
Hi.

00:19:39.928 --> 00:19:42.638
So no ring. Can I assume
you're also a single parent?

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:47.476
- I am a single parent.
- It's hard, isn't it?

00:19:47.644 --> 00:19:51.147
There's no time for a social life.
Where are you gonna meet someone?

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:52.607
Well, um...

00:19:52.816 --> 00:19:57.904
...let's say, I don't know, you met
someone in the pediatrician's office. Uh.

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:01.532
Rossie? We're ready for you.

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.709
Um, yeah...

00:20:13.587 --> 00:20:17.715
Come on, Ross Jr.
It's time to go in.

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.718
Mommy.

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.933
Mommy, what's wrong with that man?

00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:29.518
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!

00:20:37.069 --> 00:20:40.112
- Oh, good, you haven't left yet.
- Where have you been?

00:20:40.322 --> 00:20:43.616
I got held up
at Dr. Gettleman's office, um.

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:47.745
There was some guy that, uh,
freaked everybody out.

00:20:48.747 --> 00:20:51.332
You got here just in time.
I really have to go, buddy.

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.583
Oh, man.

00:20:52.793 --> 00:20:56.629
- Promise to call me when you land?
- Of course I will. I love you.

00:20:56.838 --> 00:20:57.964
I love you too.

00:21:00.384 --> 00:21:02.885
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa!

00:21:03.053 --> 00:21:05.429
Whoa, watch the tongue, people.
We got a baby over here.

00:21:07.557 --> 00:21:10.309
- Bye, Chandler.
- Aw. Bye.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.728
- Bye, honey.
- Bye.

00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:20.987
- What's the matter, Joe?
- I'm mad at you for leaving.

00:21:21.154 --> 00:21:25.032
You know, you're nothing
but a big leaver.

00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:28.744
A big leaver with a stupid suitcase.

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:34.625
Any chance you're trying to pick
a fight to make all of this easier?

00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:40.423
Aw, dude, you see right through me!

00:21:50.434 --> 00:21:52.810
Okay, well... Bye, Mon.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.521
Bye, Ross. Rachel.

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:59.233
- Bye, Emma.
- Okay, bye-bye.

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:02.611
Have a good trip. Okay.
Oh, my God.

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:06.449
Chandler.

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:08.326
Wait.

00:22:10.078 --> 00:22:13.039
It goes old job...

00:22:13.206 --> 00:22:15.291
...new job...

00:22:15.459 --> 00:22:16.625
...and you.

00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:20.755
This is just something I have to do.

00:22:21.381 --> 00:22:23.382
I know.

00:22:23.592 --> 00:22:25.885
I love you so much.

00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:28.471
I know that too.

00:22:40.233 --> 00:22:43.819
Don't worry.
I'll be back before you know it.

00:22:44.196 --> 00:22:45.905
Yes, it will be the same.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.241
Because I know, that's how.

00:22:49.409 --> 00:22:50.534
I promise.

00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:52.036
You double promise?

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:58.292
Call me when you land.

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:02.254
- Can I talk now?
- Okay, bye.

00:23:02.422 --> 00:23:04.382
- Joey!
- He had to board.
