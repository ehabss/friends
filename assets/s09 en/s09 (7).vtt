WEBVTT

00:00:05.213 --> 00:00:08.382
And that's why,
no matter what Mommy says...

00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:12.511
...we really were on a break.
Yes, we were.

00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:16.974
Yes, we were. Heh.
Come here, gorgeous.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:21.437
Look at you.
You are the cutest little baby ever.

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:25.441
You're just a little-bitty baby,
you know that? But you've got...

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.609
You've got big, beautiful eyes.

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.905
Yes, you do. And a...
And a big, round belly.

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.576
Big baby butt.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.663
I like big butts.

00:00:40.623 --> 00:00:43.375
I like big butts and I cannot lie

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.294
You other brothers can't deny

00:00:45.462 --> 00:00:47.421
When a girl walks in
With an itty-bitty waist

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:49.465
And a round thing in your face
You get...

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:57.431
Oh, my God, Emma.
You're laughing.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.517
Oh, my God. You've never
done that before, have you?

00:01:00.727 --> 00:01:04.271
You've never done that before.
Daddy made you laugh, huh?

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:07.232
Well, Daddy and Sir Mix-A-Lot.

00:01:08.693 --> 00:01:11.361
What? What?
You wanna hear some more? Um...

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.325
My anaconda don't want none
Unless you got buns, hun

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.997
I'm a terrible father. Oh.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.090
- Hey.
- Hey, listen.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.135
- What do you know about investments?
- How come?

00:02:16.344 --> 00:02:20.222
I'm starting to make good money on the
show, and I should do something with it.

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:24.560
- What do you do with your money now?
- It's taped to the back of my toilet tank.

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.772
I didn't say that.
It's in a bank guarded by robots.

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.235
- Do you have any ideas?
- Uh, this guy at work got me excited...

00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:36.613
...about going in on an emu farm.
That'd be kind of cool, huh?

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:40.450
Pitching in on the weekends,
helping to plant the emus.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:45.706
Joe, emus are birds.
You raise them for meat.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.207
Yeah. Right!

00:02:49.794 --> 00:02:51.920
People eat birds. Bird meat.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.591
Do they just fly into your mouth?
Or you go in a restaurant and say:

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.886
"Excuse me, I'll have
a bucket of fried bird." Ha-ha-ha.

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:02.264
Or maybe just a wing. Or a...

00:03:03.975 --> 00:03:05.184
Mm-hm.
- Ahem.

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.811
You should consider something
a little less risky.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.397
I think real estate is
your best investment.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:14.735
The Fed just lowered the rates, and the
interest on your mortgage is deductible.

00:03:16.154 --> 00:03:18.488
That's right. I know some stuff.

00:03:18.698 --> 00:03:20.282
Real estate, huh? Hmm.

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.118
Oh! And you know who's selling
a great apartment? Richard!

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:27.206
Oh, and you know whose knowledge of
her ex-boyfriend is shocking? Monica!

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.750
My dad told me.
They play golf together.

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:32.085
Oh! Well, maybe
I'll join them sometime.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.755
I just hope the club doesn't
slip out of my hand...

00:03:34.964 --> 00:03:37.382
...and beat the mustache
off his face.

00:03:44.682 --> 00:03:48.727
Hi! You have to help me pick a dress.
I'm meeting Mike's parents tonight.

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:51.855
Wow, the boyfriend's parents.
Big step.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:56.860
- Really? That hadn't occurred to me.
- They'll love you. Just be yourself.

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.738
They live on the Upper East Side
on Park Avenue.

00:03:59.948 --> 00:04:02.449
- Oh, yeah, she can't be herself.
- Ugh.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.702
Okay, so, all right, which dress?

00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:13.752
- You can say neither.
- Oh, God. Neither.

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.755
I'm sorry. We'll take you shopping.
It'll be fine.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:20.509
You are in such good hands,
and I am so good with meeting parents.

00:04:20.718 --> 00:04:23.720
With the father, you wanna flirt a little,
but not in a gross way.

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:24.930
Uh-huh.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:28.558
Just kind of like, "Mr. Pinzer, I can
see where Wallace gets his good looks."

00:04:28.768 --> 00:04:33.146
- You went out with Wallace Pinzer?
- Oh, he took the SATs for me.

00:04:33.982 --> 00:04:39.111
- I knew you didn't get a 1400!
- Yeah, well, duh! I mean...

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.780
So now, what about with Mike's mom?

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.490
Oh! Well, with the mother...

00:04:43.658 --> 00:04:46.410
...just constantly
tell her how amazing her son is.

00:04:46.577 --> 00:04:50.122
Take it from me. Moms love me.
Ross' mom one time actually said...

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:52.499
...I am like the daughter
that she never had.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:05:01.633
- She said what?
- She's like the daughter she never had.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:03.010
Listen.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:14.021
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.815
I just got Phoebe all dressed
to meet Mike's parents.

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:19.401
She's so nervous. It's so sweet.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.737
Guess what. I made Emma laugh today.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.531
You what? And I missed it...

00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:28.493
...because I was giving a makeover
to that stupid hippie?

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.831
Yeah, and it was, uh, like, uh,
a real little person laugh too.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:35.375
- Oh!
- It was like, um:

00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:44.009
Only not creepy.

00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:45.385
Yeah.

00:05:45.595 --> 00:05:48.805
- What did you do to make her laugh?
- I, um...

00:05:49.015 --> 00:05:51.641
Well, I sang. Actually...

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:54.394
...I rapped, um, heh...

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:56.063
..."Baby Got Back."

00:05:58.024 --> 00:05:59.900
You what?

00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:03.362
You sang to our baby daughter...

00:06:03.571 --> 00:06:06.031
...a song about a guy
who likes to have sex...

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.283
...with women with giant asses?

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.203
You know what,
if you think about it...

00:06:11.412 --> 00:06:15.957
...it actually promotes
a healthy, uh, body image...

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:18.502
...because even big butts...

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:22.089
...or, uh, "juicy doubles" are...
- Oh.

00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:29.221
Please don't take her away from me.

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:38.188
Oh, hi, come on in.
I'm Catherine, the listing agent.

00:06:38.398 --> 00:06:39.898
Hi, I'm Joey. This is Chandler.

00:06:40.108 --> 00:06:43.819
So how come Richard's selling
the place? Went bankrupt?

00:06:44.028 --> 00:06:47.781
Medical malpractice?
Choked on his own mustache?

00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:52.411
He's buying a much bigger place.
It's got a great view of Central Park...

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.704
That's enough out of you.

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:57.624
Uh, is there anything we should know
about the place?

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:02.295
All the appliances are included.
There's a lot of light, a new kitchen.

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:05.465
I think you guys would be
very happy here.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:11.179
- Ha. No, no, no.
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:07:12.265 --> 00:07:15.475
No, we're not together.
We're definitely not a couple.

00:07:15.685 --> 00:07:18.687
- Oh, okay. Sorry.
- That's all right.

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:21.982
Wow, you, uh, seemed
pretty insulted by that.

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.818
What, I'm not good enough for you?

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:27.946
We are not gonna have
this conversation again.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:33.076
Look at this place.
Why am I so intimidated by this guy?

00:07:33.286 --> 00:07:36.872
Pretentious art.
This huge, macho couch.

00:07:37.081 --> 00:07:39.040
When we know
all he does is sit around...

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.003
...crying about losing Monica
to a real man. Ha, ha.

00:07:43.588 --> 00:07:46.339
- You don't think he's here, do you?
- I don't know.

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:51.303
It's a nice place, but I gotta say,
I don't know if I see myself living here.

00:07:51.512 --> 00:07:52.888
Well, let me see.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.023
Yeah, I can see it.

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:07.235
Look at these videos.
I mean, who does he think he is?

00:08:07.445 --> 00:08:10.947
Magnum Force, Dirty Harry,
Cool Hand Luke.

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.908
- Oh, my God.
- What?

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:15.869
There's a tape here
with Monica's name on it.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:19.748
Ooh. A tape with a girl's name on it.
It's probably a sex tape.

00:08:21.876 --> 00:08:23.210
Wait a minute.

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:25.754
This says "Monica."

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:30.258
And this is Richard's apartment.

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:33.553
Get there faster!

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.948
Wow. You look...

00:08:53.574 --> 00:08:54.991
...like my mom.

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:59.246
I'm wearing pantyhose.

00:09:00.414 --> 00:09:02.582
- Great! Come on in.
- Okay.

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.085
- Ha-ha-ha. Hi.
- Hi.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:07.128
Oh. Thank you.

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:08.547
Oh. Heh.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:11.925
- Oh, my God. You're rich.
- No, my parents are rich.

00:09:12.134 --> 00:09:15.595
So? They gotta die someday. Hello!

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.389
Mom, Dad, this is Phoebe.

00:09:17.598 --> 00:09:20.267
Phoebe, these are my parents,
Theodore and Bitsy.

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:22.978
Theodore, Bitsy...

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:26.356
...what a delight.
Ha-ha-ha.

00:09:27.066 --> 00:09:30.652
- It's so nice to finally meet you.
- And you.

00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:33.238
Your home is lovely.

00:09:33.781 --> 00:09:37.242
Thank you. I'll give you a tour later.
It's actually three floors.

00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:39.327
Holy crap!

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:43.915
Oh. Why don't you come
meet our friends?

00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.542
Try and stop me.

00:09:45.751 --> 00:09:48.044
Hey. What are you doing?

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.088
Getting your parents to like me.

00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.716
I'm sure they will,
but you don't have to do this.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.509
I want them
to get to know Phoebe, not:

00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:55.885
"Phoebe."

00:09:56.095 --> 00:09:58.847
- You've got it.
- All right.

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.849
- It's hard to stop.
- Mm.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:03.476
Well, come on.

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:07.147
Phoebe, these are our friends
Tom and Sue Engel.

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:10.317
Phoebe, come sit.
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

00:10:10.484 --> 00:10:11.526
Mm-hm.

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:13.862
- So where are you from?
- Um, okay.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:17.532
Well, all right.
Um, originally, I'm from upstate...

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:20.994
...but, um, then my mom killed herself,
and my stepdad went to prison.

00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.622
So I moved to the city...

00:10:23.789 --> 00:10:26.833
...where, um, I lived in a burned-out
Buick LeSabre for a while.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:28.543
Which was okay. That was okay.

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:30.712
Until, um, I got hepatitis, you know...

00:10:30.921 --> 00:10:34.841
...because this pimp spit
in my mouth and...

00:10:36.218 --> 00:10:37.636
But I got over it.

00:10:37.845 --> 00:10:42.265
And, um, anyway, now I'm a, um,
freelance massage therapist...

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:47.395
...um, which isn't always steady money,
but at least I don't pay taxes.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.072
So where does everyone summer?

00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:08.500
- Oh, God, this is not going well.
- No, you're doing fine. Really.

00:11:08.709 --> 00:11:12.212
- Why don't you go talk to my dad?
- Okay, okay, okay.

00:11:12.421 --> 00:11:15.006
- Still sure about me being myself?
- Absolutely.

00:11:15.216 --> 00:11:17.634
Though maybe just
a little less "pimp spit."

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.010
Okay.

00:11:23.265 --> 00:11:27.519
So, Theodore, I, uh, can see
where Mike gets his good looks from.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.938
Oh. Well...

00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:34.859
- You must work out all the time.
- Oh, not all the time. I do the best I can.

00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:37.862
- Yeah, I bet. Look out!
- Oh! Ow.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.408
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Unh! I recently had surgery.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:43.660
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'll be fine.

00:11:43.869 --> 00:11:47.288
- I just should check the stitches.
- I really am sorry.

00:11:47.498 --> 00:11:50.417
How could you know? Why wouldn't
you punch me in the stomach?

00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:54.045
Um...

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.922
Did you just hit my dad?

00:11:57.049 --> 00:12:01.094
Yes. I'm sorry. I've never met
a boyfriend's parents before.

00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:03.930
But, I mean, you have met
humans before, right?

00:12:04.515 --> 00:12:06.349
Why don't you go talk to my mom?

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:09.936
Okay, yeah, your mom.
She looks nice. I can talk to her.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:14.399
You do that, and I'm gonna go check
my dad for signs of internal bleeding.

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:19.696
Oh, Bitsy? Um, uh, listen,
I wanted to thank you again...

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.114
...for having me here tonight.

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:22.532
Well, not at all.

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:26.286
Also, um, I just want you to know
what a wonderful man your son is.

00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:30.957
- Thank you. I think so too.
- It's a testament to how he was raised.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.210
Especially to you,
because he's very respectful of women.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.840
- Is he really?
- He is so considerate of my feelings.

00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:43.428
You know, I think you'd also like
to know that he is a very gentle lover.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.142
Excuse me?

00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:52.896
No, don't get me wrong.
No, not in like a sissy way.

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.731
When he gets going...

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:59.277
...he can rattle a headboard
like a sailor on leave.

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:04.407
That's... my boy.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:12.415
Awesome.

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.923
I'm not gonna watch it.
I don't need to watch it.

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:23.134
I mean, what good could
possibly come from watching it?

00:13:24.637 --> 00:13:26.721
Well, we know I'm gonna watch it.

00:13:28.057 --> 00:13:31.601
- Hey, dude, what's up?
- Don't judge me! I'm only human!

00:13:32.645 --> 00:13:33.895
Did you take that tape?

00:13:34.104 --> 00:13:37.607
I had to! Imagine you were married
and you found a tape of your wife...

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:41.361
...in another guy's apartment. Wouldn't
you need to know what was on it?

00:13:41.570 --> 00:13:44.113
I don't know. Who am I married to?

00:13:45.991 --> 00:13:47.367
Some girl.

00:13:47.576 --> 00:13:48.910
She hot?

00:13:50.287 --> 00:13:52.997
- Yeah.
- How did she get me to settle down?

00:13:54.708 --> 00:13:55.959
All right, I'm gonna watch it.

00:13:57.336 --> 00:13:59.420
I mean, it's probably
not even what I think it is.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.216
Even if it is, it can't possibly be as
bad as what I'm picturing in my head.

00:14:03.384 --> 00:14:05.218
Ha, ha. Can it?

00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:10.265
See, in my experience,
if a girl says yes to being taped...

00:14:10.474 --> 00:14:13.017
...she doesn't say no to much else,
I'll tell you.

00:14:15.396 --> 00:14:17.647
- Then you have to watch it for me.
- Whoa! What?

00:14:17.857 --> 00:14:20.525
Just for a few seconds
so I can know what it is. Please?

00:14:21.902 --> 00:14:25.196
All right, fine. But if I enjoy this,
you have only yourself to blame!

00:14:31.453 --> 00:14:34.998
- Why am I hearing cheering?
- It's okay. It's just a football game.

00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:39.502
- It's just football?
- You were all worried for nothing.

00:14:39.712 --> 00:14:41.379
It's football! It's just football!

00:14:41.589 --> 00:14:44.924
This is great! This is the first time
I've ever enjoyed football!

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:47.510
I think it may be customary
to get a beer!

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.055
What the?

00:14:53.642 --> 00:14:56.144
- What are you doing?
- You don't wanna see what I just saw!

00:14:57.897 --> 00:14:59.606
What are you guys doing?

00:14:59.815 --> 00:15:02.775
Oh, my God! Is that Richard?

00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:10.366
Okay, uh, please laugh for Mommy.
Please?

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:11.826
Please laugh for Mommy.

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:18.666
Not funny, huh?

00:15:18.876 --> 00:15:20.752
Well, so is it...

00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:25.173
...only offensive novelty rap?

00:15:25.382 --> 00:15:29.010
Or maybe just, you know, rap in general.
Because Mommy can rap.

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:32.472
My name is Mommy

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.265
And I'm here to say

00:15:34.433 --> 00:15:35.516
That all the babies are...

00:15:35.684 --> 00:15:37.393
Oh, I can't rap.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:44.901
All right, sweetheart. This is
only because I love you so much.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:49.697
And I know that you're
not gonna tell anybody.

00:15:57.414 --> 00:15:58.998
I like

00:16:00.084 --> 00:16:02.752
Big butts and I cannot lie

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:07.465
You other brothers can't deny

00:16:08.425 --> 00:16:11.052
When a girl walks in
With an itty-bitty waist

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.804
And a round thing in your face

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:16.391
Yes, yes, yes. Yes! Ha!

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.642
Oh.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:20.269
I like big butts and I cannot lie

00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:22.522
You other brothers can't deny

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:25.274
Oh, Emma, you're laughing!
Oh, you are!

00:16:25.484 --> 00:16:28.653
You really do like big butts, don't you?

00:16:29.697 --> 00:16:33.700
Oh, you beautiful little weirdo.

00:16:34.034 --> 00:16:35.118
Oh.

00:16:35.285 --> 00:16:38.204
- Hey.
- Oh, you missed it! She was laughing!

00:16:38.414 --> 00:16:39.706
- Oh, it was amazing.
- Oh.

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:43.501
It was amazing. It was the most
beautiful, beautiful sound.

00:16:43.669 --> 00:16:45.336
Oh, I know, isn't it?

00:16:46.714 --> 00:16:48.631
Oh, what did you do
to get her to laugh?

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:52.844
Oh, you know, I just...
A couple of things I tried. Different...

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:55.722
Just sang a little
"The ltsy-Bitsy Spider."

00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:59.600
You sang "Baby Got Back,"
didn't you?

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:04.272
Nothing else worked!
That girl is all about the ass!

00:17:05.524 --> 00:17:07.191
And then it goes back to the chorus.

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.360
Smelly cat, smelly cat

00:17:09.528 --> 00:17:12.030
It's not your fault

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.866
Resolve.
And that's the end of the song.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.745
I realize you hadn't asked
to hear it...

00:17:18.954 --> 00:17:22.707
...but, um, no one had spoken
in 17 minutes.

00:17:23.459 --> 00:17:28.796
Uh, Phoebe writes lots of songs. What
was that one you sang the other night?

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:30.673
Oh, "Pervert Parade"?

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:32.800
No.

00:17:33.343 --> 00:17:36.679
- Oh! "Ode to a Pubic Hair"?
- Stop.

00:17:40.642 --> 00:17:42.769
Oh, God. Is that veal?

00:17:42.978 --> 00:17:45.188
Mom, I thought I told you,
Phoebe's a vegetarian.

00:17:45.355 --> 00:17:46.522
Oh.

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:50.568
No, that's okay. That's okay.
I mean, I am a vegetarian...

00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:54.405
...except for veal.
Yeah. No. Veal I love. Heh.

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:59.243
- Phoebe, you don't have to eat that.
- Any baby animals. Kittens, fish babies.

00:17:59.995 --> 00:18:02.038
But, you know, especially veal.

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:06.334
You know, and this nice vein of fat
running through it.

00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:23.726
- Mm. Yummy.
Ha-ha-ha.

00:18:34.279 --> 00:18:36.447
So...

00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:37.990
What do you think?

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.455
So you stole that tape
from Richard's apartment?

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:48.459
Listen to the judgment
from the porn star!

00:18:49.753 --> 00:18:53.172
That tape was never meant
to be seen by...

00:18:53.382 --> 00:18:56.592
Joey, I would feel more comfortable
if this conversation were in private.

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.179
Ha, ha, Monica, look, I don't think
you and I have any secrets anymore.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.144
Not ready to joke about it yet?
See you later.

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:10.439
Why in the world would you take
this tape? And why would you watch it?

00:19:10.607 --> 00:19:12.942
Because that's who I am. Okay?

00:19:13.527 --> 00:19:17.196
I'm sure a man like Richard could see
a tape like that and not be bothered.

00:19:17.406 --> 00:19:19.240
It'd just be another saucy anecdote...

00:19:19.449 --> 00:19:23.828
...for him to share at his men's club
over brandy and mustaches.

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:28.249
Is all of this about you not being able
to grow a mustache?

00:19:29.251 --> 00:19:32.253
This is about you and Richard.
He's clearly not over you.

00:19:32.462 --> 00:19:35.173
He keeps a tape so he can
look at it whenever he wants.

00:19:35.382 --> 00:19:39.093
Isn't that sad?
Can't you see how pathetic that is?

00:19:39.303 --> 00:19:41.762
Don't be jealous.
You should feel bad for him.

00:19:41.972 --> 00:19:44.807
Oh, yeah, well, poor Richard, he...

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:47.185
I can grow a mustache.

00:19:48.395 --> 00:19:53.316
This is not our problem. We have
each other. That's all that matters.

00:19:53.817 --> 00:19:58.613
But I just keep picturing you rolling
around with him, with your...

00:19:58.822 --> 00:20:00.656
...cowboy boots in the air.

00:20:01.742 --> 00:20:06.537
Cowboy boots? I've never worn
cowboy boots in my whole life.

00:20:06.747 --> 00:20:09.081
Oh, good, good. Play more
because I wanna see how it ends.

00:20:11.043 --> 00:20:13.961
- That's not me!
- What?

00:20:15.631 --> 00:20:18.758
That's not you! Life is good again!

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:22.220
Ride 'em, cowgirl!

00:20:22.763 --> 00:20:26.224
That bastard taped over me!

00:20:28.101 --> 00:20:30.311
Is that a problem?

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.024
It's just so insulting.
Spring for a new blank tape, doctor!

00:20:37.277 --> 00:20:39.362
I can't imagine what he sees in her.

00:20:39.529 --> 00:20:42.490
She actually makes me miss
that pill-popping ex-wife of his.

00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.370
- Hello, dear.
- Hey.

00:20:47.579 --> 00:20:50.248
- What's going on?
- We were just chitchatting.

00:20:50.457 --> 00:20:53.417
- How's your friend?
- A little better.

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:58.214
Do you know who's moving back into
town? Tom and Sue's daughter, Jen.

00:20:58.423 --> 00:21:02.969
You remember her, Michael.
She's lovely, well-behaved and single.

00:21:03.178 --> 00:21:07.223
- I'm not interested.
- Oh, please, darling, let's be honest.

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:10.559
You can have all the sailor fun
you want with that one.

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:13.688
- But let's be real.
- All right, stop.

00:21:13.897 --> 00:21:18.359
All Phoebe has done is try and get you
to like her. Maybe it's not clear...

00:21:18.568 --> 00:21:19.735
...but she did her best.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:25.241
- She's a little different than you are.
- Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth.

00:21:26.827 --> 00:21:30.371
So what? If I can
get past that, it shouldn't bother you.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.833
You don't have to like her.
Just accept the fact that I do.

00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:36.335
If you can't even be civil
to the woman I love...

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:39.755
- The woman you what?
- Yeah, the woman you what?

00:21:42.718 --> 00:21:44.468
The woman I love.

00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:50.349
I love you.

00:21:52.185 --> 00:21:56.731
Something I shouldn't say for
the first time, in front of my parents...

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:59.317
...and Tom and Sue.

00:21:59.526 --> 00:22:03.321
Who are, by the way, the most sinfully
boring people I've ever met in my life.

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.452
- I love you too.
- You do?

00:22:09.661 --> 00:22:11.329
Yeah. Ha, ha.

00:22:11.538 --> 00:22:13.080
How great is this?

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.377
- Wanna get out of here?
- Okay.

00:22:18.587 --> 00:22:23.049
- Mom, Dad. Thanks for dinner.
- I had a great time.

00:22:23.258 --> 00:22:25.718
It was really top-drawer.

00:22:25.886 --> 00:22:27.428
And here's something rich.

00:22:27.637 --> 00:22:31.015
Thirteen bathrooms in this place,
I threw up in the coat closet.

00:22:32.184 --> 00:22:33.434
Ta-ta!

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:40.649
She's sweat, wet

00:22:40.817 --> 00:22:42.318
Got it going like a turbo 'Vette

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:43.819
- So, fellas!
- Yeah?

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:45.112
- Fellas!
- Yeah?

00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:47.406
- Has your girlfriend got the butt?
- Hell, yeah

00:22:47.574 --> 00:22:48.574
- So shake it

00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:49.909

00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:51.619
Shake that nasty butt

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:58.417

And I cannot lie

00:22:58.585 --> 00:22:59.794
You other brothers...

00:23:02.756 --> 00:23:05.633
