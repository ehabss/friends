WEBVTT

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:04.672
Hi!

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.008
- Hey!
- Hey! Welcome back!

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.593
- How was the honeymoon?
- Oh, incredible!

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.140
Oh, champagne, candle-lit dinners,
moonlight walks on the beach.

00:00:14.306 --> 00:00:16.434
- It was so romantic.
- Oh.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.269
- So where's Mike?
- Oh, he's at the doctor.

00:00:18.436 --> 00:00:20.438
He didn't poop while we were there.

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:26.110
- I'm glad you're back. I need your help.
- Oh, why, what's up?

00:00:26.277 --> 00:00:29.530
I have an audition for this play,
and I have to speak French...

00:00:29.697 --> 00:00:32.867
...which, according to my résumé,
I'm fluent in.

00:00:33.034 --> 00:00:37.246
- Joey, you shouldn't lie on your résumé.
- Yeah, you really shouldn't.

00:00:37.413 --> 00:00:40.458
By the way, how was
that yearlong dig in Cairo?

00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:43.878
It was okay.

00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:46.922
I did not know you spoke French.

00:00:51.052 --> 00:00:53.262
Oh, oh, you're so sexy.

00:00:54.096 --> 00:00:56.766
- Well, so will you help me?
- Sure.

00:00:59.351 --> 00:01:02.146
Ha, ha, seriously, stop it.
I'm gonna jump on you.

00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:45.481
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:01:45.648 --> 00:01:47.650
Why are you wearing my apron?

00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:50.111
I'm making cookies for Erica.

00:01:50.277 --> 00:01:53.405
We have to leave soon.
Her plane comes in in about an hour.

00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:56.951
When she gets here, is it okay
if I introduce you two as my wife...

00:01:57.118 --> 00:01:59.703
...and the woman who's
carrying my child, ha, ha?

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:02.373
No?

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:04.166
Divorce?

00:02:06.127 --> 00:02:07.419
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:10.464
- Uh, you know where Rachel is?
- Haven't seen her since morning.

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:14.218
It's unbelievable. She was supposed
to meet me a half-hour ago with Emma.

00:02:14.385 --> 00:02:16.011
- Hey!
- Hey!

00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:19.640
- These are for Erica!
- She's gonna eat all those cookies?

00:02:19.807 --> 00:02:23.102
Well, I want the baby to come out
all cute and fat!

00:02:24.937 --> 00:02:27.982
- So, uh, why is Erica coming to visit?
- We wanna get to know her better.

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:31.735
And, uh, she's never been to New York,
so she wants to see the tourist spots:

00:02:31.902 --> 00:02:33.863
Statue of Liberty,
Empire State Building.

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:37.950
Oh, there's always so many people,
and they're being corralled like cattle.

00:02:38.117 --> 00:02:42.413
And, you know, there's always
some idiot who goes, "Moo."

00:02:42.913 --> 00:02:45.708
Well, if it annoys you so much,
then why do you do it?

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:49.128
Oh, hi! Hi!

00:02:49.336 --> 00:02:52.047
- Thanks for showing up 30 minutes late.
- Ross.

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:55.176
No, I'm sure you have a great excuse.
What was it, a hair appointment?

00:02:55.342 --> 00:02:58.846
Uh, a mani-pedi?
Was there a sale at Barneys?

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.099
My father had a heart attack.

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:04.602
While I was at Barneys.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.814
- Oh, my God, Rach.
- Honey?

00:03:08.981 --> 00:03:11.483
- I'm so sorry.
- Uh, is he okay?

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.111
Yeah, he's gonna be fine,
but he's heavily sedated.

00:03:14.278 --> 00:03:16.363
Okay, I'm gonna go
to Long Island with you.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.076
- I mean, you can't be alone right now.
- No, come on, I'm totally okay.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.829
I don't need you to come.

00:03:23.996 --> 00:03:29.835
- I can totally handle this on my own.
- Still, still, let me come for me.

00:03:30.002 --> 00:03:33.255
Okay. If you really need to.

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:36.425
I bet someone could use one
of Monica's freshly baked cookies.

00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:37.635
- Oh, I really could.
- Oh.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:38.844
Oh.

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:47.937
All right, it seems pretty simple.

00:03:48.103 --> 00:03:50.189
Your first line is,
"My name is Claude."

00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:52.608
- Okay.
- So just repeat after me.

00:04:00.532 --> 00:04:03.244
- Well, let's try it again.
- Okay.

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.877
Huh. It's not...

00:04:12.044 --> 00:04:14.046
...quite what I'm saying.

00:04:14.922 --> 00:04:18.092
Really?
Sounds exactly the same to me.

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.719
- It does, really?
- Yeah.

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:22.388
- Let's just try it again.
- Okay.

00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:23.806
- Really listen.
- Got it.

00:04:23.973 --> 00:04:25.015
Okay.

00:04:36.485 --> 00:04:37.861
Hey, you guys!

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.196
- Hi.
- Hey!

00:04:39.363 --> 00:04:41.865
I want you to meet
someone really special.

00:04:42.032 --> 00:04:43.784
- Phoebe, this is Erica.
- Hi.

00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:45.577
- And this is the baby!
- Oh, hi.

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.455
- Joey, EHca, baby.
- Hi.

00:04:48.622 --> 00:04:51.125
Everyone, Erica! Baby!

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:53.919
- Monica. Calm. Self.
- Ha, ha.

00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.255
- Hey, sit down.
- Thank you.

00:04:56.422 --> 00:04:59.300
It's really nice to meet you guys.
I can't believe I'm here.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:01.760
Well, welcome to New York City,
or should I say:

00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:04.638
...New York City.

00:05:06.181 --> 00:05:07.766
Why would you say that?

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.228
Okay. What are you
gonna be doing today?

00:05:11.395 --> 00:05:16.358
Well, I wanna see everything! Times
Square, Coney Island, Rockefeller Center.

00:05:16.525 --> 00:05:19.611
You should walk to the top
of the Statue of Liberty.

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:22.656
- Oh, yeah, let's do that.
- Great.

00:05:22.823 --> 00:05:24.700
This baby better be really good.

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.084
Hi, um, uh, excuse me, I'm here to see
my father. My name is Rachel Green.

00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:37.296
- And I'm Dr. Ross Geller.
- Ross, please, this is a hospital.

00:05:37.463 --> 00:05:39.631
That actually means something here.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.925
- So can we please go in?
- Absolutely.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:44.303
Rach, I think I'm gonna
wait out here...

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.432
...because, uh, my throat is feeling a
little scratchy. I don't wanna infect him.

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:53.270
- Ross, please. Don't be so scared of him.
- I am not scared of him. I'm really sick.

00:05:53.437 --> 00:05:56.607
- He's under sedation, so he's out.
- I'm feeling better.

00:06:00.277 --> 00:06:02.196
Oh, my God.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.448
Oh, oh, wow.

00:06:04.615 --> 00:06:09.203
That ear and nose hair trimmer I got him
was just money down the drain, huh?

00:06:10.162 --> 00:06:13.874
Ms. Green? Your father's doctor's on
the phone if you'd like to speak to him.

00:06:14.041 --> 00:06:15.709
Oh, great.
Um, are you gonna be okay?

00:06:15.876 --> 00:06:18.921
- He's unconscious. We'll be just fine.
- Okay.

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:59.128
- Uh, did the TV wake you?
- No.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:03.841
When you put your feet up on my bed,
you tugged on my catheter.

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:09.263
Ouchy.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:12.683
What are you doing here, Geller?

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.644
Well, I came with Rachel,
who should be back any second.

00:07:16.645 --> 00:07:20.482
- So, what's new?
- Oh, I had a little heart attack.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.734
Right. Is it painful?

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:25.070
What, the heart attack
or sitting here talking to you?

00:07:27.239 --> 00:07:30.242
Let's see if we can get
that Rachel back in here.

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:34.413
So, what's new with you? Knocked up
any more of my daughters lately?

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:36.623
Nope. Just the one. Rachel!

00:07:43.255 --> 00:07:45.090
No!

00:07:45.257 --> 00:07:48.051
Okay, maybe if we just break it down.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:53.140
Okay, let's try it one syllable at a time.
Okay, so repeat after me.

00:07:57.311 --> 00:07:58.687
Great! Okay, faster.

00:08:06.862 --> 00:08:09.907
- Okay, it's too hard. I can't teach you.
- What are you doing?

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.826
I have to go before I put your head
through a wall.

00:08:12.993 --> 00:08:16.663
No, no. Don't go, I need you!
My audition is tomorrow!

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.223
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:35.807
I was gonna make us some dinner...

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:39.645
...but all I found in your dad's fridge
was bacon and heavy cream.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:41.897
I think we solved the mystery
of the heart attack.

00:08:43.524 --> 00:08:46.026
- Did you call your parents?
- Oh, yeah. Emma's doing great.

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:47.569
Oh, good.

00:08:48.654 --> 00:08:50.239
Wow.

00:08:50.572 --> 00:08:52.032
What?

00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:54.743
I just can't believe
I'm in Rachel Green's room.

00:08:55.744 --> 00:09:00.832
- You've been in my room before.
- Hah, yeah, sure, right. Ha, ha.

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:02.918
Like I'd ever be
in Rachel Green's room.

00:09:03.085 --> 00:09:05.921
Okay, I gotta tell you, it's really weird
when you use my whole name.

00:09:06.088 --> 00:09:08.632
- Oh, ha, ha.
- Sorry.

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.678
- You okay?
- Yeah.

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:14.513
- Yeah, you had a rough day, huh?
- Yeah.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.059
It's just so weird seeing him like that,
you know? I mean, he's a doctor.

00:09:19.226 --> 00:09:22.187
You don't expect doctors to get sick.

00:09:22.354 --> 00:09:24.314
But we do.

00:09:28.277 --> 00:09:30.320
Well, he's gonna be okay, Rach.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:34.783
Aw.

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.869
I don't want him to wake up alone.
I should go to the hospital.

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.913
- What? No, no. Hey, hey, look.
- What?

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.748
They gave him a lot of medication.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:43.834
He wouldn't even know
if you were there.

00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:46.086
We'll go see him first thing
in the morning.

00:09:46.253 --> 00:09:48.839
- Really? I shouldn't feel guilty?
- No... God, hey.

00:09:49.006 --> 00:09:51.091
Rach, you've been an
amazing daughter, okay?

00:09:51.258 --> 00:09:55.345
- Right now you need to get some rest.
- Okay, maybe you're right.

00:09:55.721 --> 00:09:57.264
Good night.

00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:01.143
Wait, wait, wait.

00:10:01.768 --> 00:10:04.771
Would you stay here with me
for a little while?

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.025
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:12.904
- Thank you for coming with me today.
- Oh, of course.

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.157
Rachel Green is very happy
you're in her room.

00:10:17.451 --> 00:10:19.995
- Me too. Come here.
- No.

00:10:21.413 --> 00:10:24.416
I just don't wanna be alone tonight.

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:29.755
Okay, well, um, I can maybe grab
a sleeping bag or...

00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:46.938
No, Rach!

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:51.526
I'm sorry, I just don't
think this is a good idea.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:53.695
Well, we won't know that
until we do it, will we?

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:56.490
No, um, uh, look, um.

00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.119
You are upset about your father,
and you're feeling vulnerable...

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:03.413
...and I just don't feel
it would be right.

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:06.583
I feel like I'd be, you know,
taking advantage of you.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.962
What...? Taking advantage?
I am giving you the advantage. Enjoy!

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.424
Look, I'm sure it would be great...

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:17.886
...but I think one of us
has to be thinking clearly.

00:11:18.053 --> 00:11:20.472
So I'm gonna go.

00:11:23.684 --> 00:11:25.394
Wow.

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.270
Okay.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.776
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Mm-hm.

00:11:35.696 --> 00:11:39.658
I haven't had sex in four months.
I should get a medal for that!

00:11:45.831 --> 00:11:48.875
Thanks so much for taking me
to all those places. I had a great time.

00:11:49.042 --> 00:11:52.170
Oh, I'm glad. Listen, I wanna apologize
about Chandler, though.

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:57.008
- I just did not see this coming.
- New York is awesome!

00:11:58.844 --> 00:12:01.888
- What is with you?
- I've been to these places before...

00:12:02.055 --> 00:12:03.807
...but I've never really seen them.

00:12:03.974 --> 00:12:06.017
Yeah, you miss a lot
when you're mooing.

00:12:07.728 --> 00:12:10.939
- Thanks so much for showing me around.
- Oh, it was our pleasure.

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:13.316
We're so much enjoying
getting to know you.

00:12:13.483 --> 00:12:15.944
Well, if there's anything else
you wanna know...

00:12:17.404 --> 00:12:19.197
Oh, uh...

00:12:19.364 --> 00:12:20.907
Okay, um.

00:12:21.908 --> 00:12:24.161
Can we ask you some
questions about the father?

00:12:24.327 --> 00:12:26.079
Oh, sure. Yeah.

00:12:26.246 --> 00:12:31.001
Well, he was my high-school boyfriend,
captain of the football team, really cute.

00:12:31.877 --> 00:12:35.088
- Got a scholarship and went to college.
- That's great.

00:12:36.631 --> 00:12:39.718
Yeah, it's almost definitely him.

00:12:41.595 --> 00:12:42.846
How's that, now?

00:12:43.388 --> 00:12:46.224
Well, there's a chance
it's another guy.

00:12:46.391 --> 00:12:49.978
I mean, I've only ever been
with two guys...

00:12:50.145 --> 00:12:52.397
...but they sort of overlapped.

00:12:53.148 --> 00:12:54.649
So, what does the other guy do?

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:58.278
- Does he go to college too?
- No, he's in prison.

00:12:59.571 --> 00:13:00.614
Oh.

00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:04.034
Well, um,
was he falsely accused of something?

00:13:04.951 --> 00:13:06.328
No.

00:13:06.495 --> 00:13:08.789
He killed his father with a shovel.

00:13:10.957 --> 00:13:12.667
Other than that, he's a great guy.

00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:15.754
I'll bet his dad doesn't think so.

00:13:24.596 --> 00:13:26.807
- Are you awake?
- Of course I'm awake.

00:13:26.973 --> 00:13:29.684
Assume from now on
that I'm always awake.

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:35.482
All right, we don't know that it's him.
I mean, it could be the football guy.

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:38.819
Honey, it's us.
Of course it's the shovel killer.

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:44.950
Well, all right, let's say that it is him.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.785
Would we not want the baby? No.

00:13:46.952 --> 00:13:50.372
- Would we treat him any differently?
- I'd keep an eye on him.

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.043
We have to find out
which the father is.

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:57.003
- How?
- I don't know.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.299
- They have tests for these things, right?
- Yeah, but maybe we're overreacting.

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:04.803
Easy for you to say.
He's a father killer.

00:14:05.512 --> 00:14:07.264
He probably loves his mommy.

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:10.976
He's probably got a tattoo that says
"Mom" on his shovel-wielding arm.

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:18.984
We'll now count from one to five.

00:14:29.744 --> 00:14:32.247
Good job.
- Thank you.

00:14:33.874 --> 00:14:35.500
- Hey.
- Hey, JOEY-

00:14:35.667 --> 00:14:39.212
Listen, I feel really badly about
yesterday, and I thought about it a lot.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:42.966
No, I was too impatient.
So let's try it again.

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.885
That's okay. I don't need your help.

00:14:45.051 --> 00:14:48.013
I worked on it myself,
and I gotta say, I am pretty good.

00:14:49.014 --> 00:14:52.642
- Really, can I hear some of it?
- Sure, sure.

00:14:53.643 --> 00:14:56.187
Okay. Ahem.

00:15:02.944 --> 00:15:04.529
See?

00:15:05.488 --> 00:15:07.324
Right, but you're not...

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:09.326
You're not... You're...

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:12.579
Again, you're not speaking French!

00:15:14.539 --> 00:15:18.293
Oh, well, I think I am! Yeah, and I think
I'm definitely gonna get the part!

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.545
How could you possibly think that?

00:15:20.712 --> 00:15:23.423
The guy on the tape said
I was doing a good job!

00:15:27.594 --> 00:15:30.347
Hey, Rach, can you grab me
a cup of coffee?

00:15:32.557 --> 00:15:34.017
Sure.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.812
You've been quiet all morning.
ls everything okay?

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:40.023
Mm-hm.

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:43.693
- You sure you're all right?
- Yep.

00:15:44.819 --> 00:15:46.154
Okay. Um.

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:48.782
Well, I'm gonna go, uh,
grab us some breakfast.

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:51.785
- FYI.
- There it is.

00:15:53.078 --> 00:15:59.876
In the future, when a girl asks for some
ill-advised sympathy sex, just do it.

00:16:00.919 --> 00:16:05.090
Wait, wait, you're, uh, mad at me
about last night?

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:08.009
- I was just trying to do the right thing.
- Really?

00:16:08.176 --> 00:16:09.844
If you had done the right thing...

00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:12.931
...I wouldn't have woken up
feeling stupid and embarrassed.

00:16:13.098 --> 00:16:16.518
I would've woken up feeling
comforted and satisfied.

00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.939
- Well...
- Oh, stop that!

00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:24.776
I can't believe this!
I was just being a good guy.

00:16:24.943 --> 00:16:27.529
I treated you with
respect and understanding.

00:16:27.696 --> 00:16:29.197
Oh, that is so hot.

00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:32.158
Hey, I was looking out for you.

00:16:32.325 --> 00:16:34.661
Oh, really? Well, you know what?
lam a big girl.

00:16:34.828 --> 00:16:37.497
I don't need someone telling me
what is best for me.

00:16:38.873 --> 00:16:42.335
I gotta say, I've not had sex a lot
of times before. This is the worst ever!

00:16:42.502 --> 00:16:46.881
Oh, oh, really? Really?
Well, it wasn't very good for me either.

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:49.217
Oh, okay, you know...?
Hey, hey, you know what?

00:16:49.384 --> 00:16:51.469
To avoid this little thing
in the future...

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:54.264
...let's just say, you and me?
Never having sex again.

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:57.017
- What?
- That's right! Sex is off the table!

00:16:57.183 --> 00:17:00.854
I am never having sex with you again!

00:17:07.068 --> 00:17:09.571
Dr. Green, are you feeling better?

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:15.410
- Hey! How was lunch?
- We had a good time.

00:17:15.577 --> 00:17:18.455
By the way, I wanted
to ask you something.

00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:21.875
It would really mean a lot to me
if the baby was a boy...

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:24.127
...that you name him after my father...

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:26.421
...Jiminy Billy Bob.

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:34.012
- Oh, really?
- No! Ha, ha.

00:17:34.179 --> 00:17:36.598
- You were right. That was fun.
- Ha-ha-ha.

00:17:38.725 --> 00:17:40.435
I'm gonna go finish packing.

00:17:40.602 --> 00:17:42.062
- Okay.
- Ha, ha.

00:17:44.647 --> 00:17:47.650
- So is she gonna take the test?
- No, she doesn't have to.

00:17:47.817 --> 00:17:50.153
- I found out who the father is.
- Oh, God.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:53.281
- It's Shovely Joe, isn't it'?
- No, it's not.

00:17:53.448 --> 00:17:54.532
How do you know?

00:17:54.699 --> 00:17:57.285
Erica didn't pay attention
in sex ed. class...

00:17:57.452 --> 00:17:59.913
...because the things she did
with that prison guy?

00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:02.165
It'd be pretty hard to make
a baby that way.

00:18:02.332 --> 00:18:06.669
Oh, God, what was it? The thing we
hardly ever do, or the thing we never do?

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:10.673
The thing we never do.

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:13.968
Shovely Joe.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:26.231
- Whenever you're ready, Joey.
- Right. Ahem.

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:39.536
- I'm sorry, what's going on?
- Dude, come on, French it up.

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:42.580
Joey, do you speak French?

00:18:49.838 --> 00:18:52.006
You know what?
I think this audition is over.

00:18:53.049 --> 00:18:55.635
Uh, excuse me?

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:58.805
Uh, I am Régine Phalange.

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:03.935
Uh, I was passing by when
I heard this man speaking...

00:19:04.102 --> 00:19:10.191
...the regional dialect of my
French town of Estée Lauder.

00:19:12.152 --> 00:19:13.987
You really think this man
is speaking French?

00:19:43.892 --> 00:19:46.561
Good job, little buddy.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.274
That was some really good French.

00:19:51.441 --> 00:19:54.277
But I think we're gonna go
with someone else for the part.

00:19:54.444 --> 00:19:57.947
- Oh, all right, but my French was good?
- It was great.

00:19:58.114 --> 00:19:59.532
Oh, ha, ha, see?

00:20:09.792 --> 00:20:12.629
- Emma's down for the night.
- Oh, good.

00:20:12.795 --> 00:20:16.674
- So, uh, I guess I'm gonna take oh'.
- Okay.

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:19.594
Hey, listen, uh, just before you go...

00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:22.013
I just wanna say thank you
for coming with me.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:23.598
Oh, no problem.

00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:26.768
And also, you know, I, uh...

00:20:26.935 --> 00:20:31.689
I was thinking about what you said, uh,
you know, about the whole sex thing...

00:20:31.856 --> 00:20:35.360
Probably not a great idea
to go down that road again.

00:20:35.777 --> 00:20:38.905
Thank you. I'm glad you agree.

00:20:39.072 --> 00:20:41.407
It's a shame, though.
When we did it, it was pretty good.

00:20:43.618 --> 00:20:44.953
Yeah.

00:20:45.119 --> 00:20:47.455
Yeah, that's true.

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:50.792
Hey, um, do you remember
that one really great time?

00:20:50.959 --> 00:20:52.752
- Oh, yeah!
- You know?

00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:56.172
- It was Valentine's Day.
- It was your birthday.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:59.550
Oh, yeah.

00:21:03.054 --> 00:21:06.891
Well, I guess that's all
in the past now.

00:21:08.142 --> 00:21:09.686
Mm-hm.

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:15.108
- Not even one more time.
- Not even once.

00:21:15.608 --> 00:21:18.945
- No matter how much we want it.
- Even if we want it...

00:21:19.112 --> 00:21:20.989
- ...really bad.
- That's what we decided.

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:24.075
Yeah, ha, ha, that's right.

00:21:26.953 --> 00:21:29.580
- It's kind of hard, though. You know?
- Yeah.

00:21:29.747 --> 00:21:34.085
When two people have a connection,
you know, that's...

00:21:34.544 --> 00:21:36.754
Just seems like...

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.423
...such a...

00:21:38.589 --> 00:21:40.550
...waste.

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:45.221
I hate waste.

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:53.187
- Ross?
- Yes?

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.189
Just so you know...

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:58.026
...with us...

00:21:58.401 --> 00:22:00.737
...it's never off the table.

00:22:11.414 --> 00:22:14.667
Damn it, it's never off the table.

00:22:23.676 --> 00:22:26.846
- Okay, can you really tap-dance?
- No.

00:22:27.013 --> 00:22:29.057
It's off the résumé.

00:22:29.932 --> 00:22:32.268
- Archery?
- No.

00:22:32.435 --> 00:22:35.730
- Horseback riding?
- Would fall off a lot.

00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:39.734
You can drink a gallon of milk
in 10 seconds?

00:22:39.901 --> 00:22:41.527
That I can do.

00:22:41.861 --> 00:22:45.531
Come on, you can drink
a gallon of milk in 10 seconds?

00:22:45.698 --> 00:22:47.617
All right, watch me.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:54.207
- Okay, you time me, ready?
- Ready, go!

00:23:24.529 --> 00:23:25.571
You did it!
