WEBVTT

00:00:02.836 --> 00:00:06.005
You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma
have her first cookie.

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:08.799
Her first cookie?
She has cookies all the time.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.802
I've never given her a cookie.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.639
- Have you?
- No.

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.810
No. And for the record, I've also
never given her frosting from a can.

00:00:21.312 --> 00:00:24.440
Hey, Rach, the adoption agency
needs letters of recommendation...

00:00:24.607 --> 00:00:26.942
...and we wondered
if you would write one for us?

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.986
Of course. I would be honored.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:30.195
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:36.702
I think there's been an oversight.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.122
Joe, we would have asked you.
We thought you wouldn't be interested.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.960
Yeah, it's just that we don't think of you
as really being so much with the words.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:50.591
Clearly, we were wrong.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.595
I got a lot of nice stuff
to say about you guys, okay?

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.139
And I know how much you want
to have a baby...

00:00:57.307 --> 00:00:59.641
...and I would love to help you get one.

00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:03.645
You know what?
Then we want you to do it.

00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:07.357
Thank you. All right.
Let me see how I'm gonna start.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.944
"Dear Baby Adoption Decider People..."

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.991
So excited about your letter.

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.037
- Hey.
- Hey, Phoebe.

00:01:20.205 --> 00:01:24.166
- Wow, don't you look nice.
- Yes, I do.

00:01:25.293 --> 00:01:27.669
Today's Mike and my
one-year anniversary.

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:29.421
What's it the anniversary of?

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.425
Your first, uh, date, your first kiss,
first time you had sex?

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:34.843
Yeah.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:39.765
So you must be going somewhere
fancy to celebrate.

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.350
Uh-huh. Um, a Knicks game.

00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:44.269
Uh, ha, ha...
Aren't you a little overdressed?

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.647
Hey, I've never had a one-year
anniversary before...

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:49.691
...so no matter where we go,
I'm wearing something fancy...

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:51.777
...and I'm gonna put on
my finest jewelry...

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:54.822
...and we're gonna have sex
in a public restroom.

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.698
You guys do that?

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.910
Chandler won't even have sex
in our bathroom.

00:02:00.578 --> 00:02:02.871
That's where people make number two.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:59.178
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:05.976
So, you know, I have a little time
if you want to...

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.020
Oh. Oh...

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:11.148
I'd love to, but I really have
to grade these papers.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:14.067
Oh... Fine. It's fine.

00:03:14.235 --> 00:03:16.195
I'll just shower by myself.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:20.991
B. B. B. B. B.

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.620
Ross, you gave a B
to a Pottery Barn catalog.

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:27.497
Well, it had some good ideas.
Take off your shirt.

00:03:29.083 --> 00:03:32.794
- Damn it.
- Rachel, open! It's your sister!

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:35.297
I have to talk to you.

00:03:36.257 --> 00:03:38.050
Hi, Amy.

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:45.182
- You're not Rachel.
- Still sharp as a tack.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:50.062
Um, Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy.
Amy, this is Charlie.

00:03:50.271 --> 00:03:52.356
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, hi.

00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:53.815
And you are?

00:03:59.197 --> 00:04:02.866
Ross? I grew up on your block?

00:04:03.826 --> 00:04:06.286
We had Thanksgiving together
last year?

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:08.372
I had a baby with your sister?

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.291
No. I...

00:04:12.418 --> 00:04:15.087
Did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?

00:04:18.508 --> 00:04:20.759
Yes. Yes, you did.

00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:27.641
Hi, Rachel. Here's your sister Amy.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.352
She thinks I need pec implants.

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:32.688
Amy? Hi.

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:35.983
- You remember Joey.
- Yeah. Hey, sure.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.735
- The Days of our Lives guy.
- That's right, yeah.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.321
You are not good.

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.993
Always nice to meet a fan.

00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:49.538
- So, now, what are you doing here?
- I have huge news.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:55.335
- Hold on. Let me check on the baby.
- This is important. Can't Ella wait?

00:04:55.503 --> 00:04:57.546
Uh, her name is Emma.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.717
Why did you change it?
Ella was so much prettier.

00:05:03.261 --> 00:05:07.014
What do I know? I just sell
Middle Eastern food from a cart.

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:09.433
Hey, your English is getting better.

00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:16.273
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.650
She may be the hottest girl
I've ever hated.

00:05:19.193 --> 00:05:22.696
- What you working on?
- Monica and Chandler's recommendation.

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:26.241
I want it to sound smart, but I don't
know any big words or anything.

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.287
- Why don't you use your thesaurus?
- What did I just say?

00:05:31.748 --> 00:05:33.165
Watch.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:38.545
Here, you highlight the word
you want to change, uh, go under "tools"...

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:41.089
...and the thesaurus generates... Gives.

00:05:43.134 --> 00:05:45.594
Gives a whole list of choices.

00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:48.221
You can pick the word
that sounds smartest.

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.807
My God, that's great. I'm smart.

00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:52.351
No, no, I'm:

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:56.021
"Brainy, bright, clever." I love this thing!

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:59.691
Look out, ladies!
Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!

00:06:02.153 --> 00:06:03.612
God...

00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:06.323
...so beautiful.

00:06:06.491 --> 00:06:08.075
I know, isn't she?

00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:11.036
No, I was talking about your bedding.

00:06:13.414 --> 00:06:17.000
- All right, what's your news, Amy?
- Oh. Ahem.

00:06:17.168 --> 00:06:18.543
Well...

00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.504
...I'm getting married.

00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:22.839
Wow! Oh, my God!

00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:25.675
- To who?
- This guy.

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:30.222
He has a killer apartment.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.811
- And?
- And it's on 5th.

00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:38.980
And the elevator opens up
right into the living room.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.275
- No, what's he like?
- Oh, he's okay.

00:06:44.112 --> 00:06:46.321
Do you remember
my old boyfriend Mark?

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:49.783
- Yeah.
- It's his dad.

00:06:51.327 --> 00:06:54.704
- Huh. Wow, so he's gotta be...
- Old? Yeah.

00:06:56.707 --> 00:06:59.501
But he travels a lot,
so he's hardly ever there.

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:04.381
Sweetie, I gotta tell you,
it sounds a little bit like...

00:07:04.549 --> 00:07:07.092
...you like the apartment
more than you like...

00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:08.552
Myron.

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:10.554
Yeah, I told you he was old.

00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:13.348
Sit down. Sit down.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.100
Oh, honey, you know...

00:07:15.268 --> 00:07:18.270
...I once also almost married
somebody that I didn't love.

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:20.814
- Do you remember Barry?
- Remember him?

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:24.526
God, we used to make out all the time
after you went to sleep.

00:07:26.529 --> 00:07:29.197
Sometimes just nodding is okay.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.992
Um... But anyway, listen.

00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:35.954
Not marrying Barry was the best
decision that I ever, ever made.

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:40.292
Honey, Amy, you deserve true love.
Your soul mate is out there somewhere.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:45.380
Someone that is your age,
that is smart, that is fun...

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:48.383
...and that you care about.

00:07:50.052 --> 00:07:51.303
You're right.

00:07:51.471 --> 00:07:53.722
- You're right. I'm gonna do it.
- Okay.

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:56.766
I'm gonna marry Myron
and keep looking for Mr. Right.

00:07:56.934 --> 00:07:58.518
Okay.

00:08:00.104 --> 00:08:02.189
Okay, let's keep talking.

00:08:10.907 --> 00:08:13.909
Excuse me. Anniversary.

00:08:14.243 --> 00:08:17.245
Excuse me. Anniversary.

00:08:17.705 --> 00:08:19.748
Um, yeah.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:24.336
Sir, could you move your nachos?
They're in my seat.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:28.507
It's my anniversary.

00:08:32.762 --> 00:08:34.429
Here we are.

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:37.933
- I can't believe it's been a whole year.
- I know.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:39.768
This has been the best year...

00:08:41.562 --> 00:08:44.648
- This has been the best year of my life!
- Me too!

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:47.400
I never thought I could
love someone this much!

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:49.611
I feel the same way!

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:54.282
You're so generous and kind,
and you're amazing in bed!

00:08:57.828 --> 00:08:59.663
It's our anniversary.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.710
Please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboard.

00:09:05.878 --> 00:09:07.754
Someone has a special question to ask.

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:11.091
Aw...

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:17.889
Oh, how lame.
It's so tacky and impersonal.

00:09:18.057 --> 00:09:21.601
- Really?
- It's the worst way to propose.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:25.230
Excuse me.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:32.237
Hey. I finished my recommendation.
Here.

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.782
And I think you'll be very, very happy.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:39.369
It's the longest I ever spent
on a computer without looking at porn.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.957
I don't understand.

00:09:44.959 --> 00:09:48.086
Some of the words a little
too sophisticated for you?

00:09:48.796 --> 00:09:50.797
It doesn't make any sense.

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:55.260
Well, of course it does. It's smart.
I used a thesaurus.

00:09:56.137 --> 00:09:57.887
On every word?

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:01.349
Yep.

00:10:01.851 --> 00:10:05.520
All right, what was
this sentence originally?

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.898
"They are warm, nice people
with big hearts."

00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:14.029
And that became, "They are humid,
prepossessing Homo sapiens...

00:10:14.196 --> 00:10:17.490
...with full-sized aortic pumps."

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.537
Yeah. Yeah. And hey,
I really mean it, dude.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.875
All right, Joey,
I don't think we can use this.

00:10:27.043 --> 00:10:29.210
- Why not?
- Well, because you signed it:

00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:32.339
"Baby Kangaroo Tribbiani."

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:40.430
Why don't you stop worrying about
sounding smart and just be yourself?

00:10:40.598 --> 00:10:43.350
You don't need a thesaurus.
Just write from here.

00:10:43.517 --> 00:10:45.477
Your full-sized aortic pump.

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:52.984
- Amy. Hi.
- I took your advice.

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:56.404
- I left Myron.
- Good for you!

00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:59.658
I know. I'm Erin Brockovich.

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:03.995
Yes, you are.

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:07.082
- Aw, I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:09.042
- Oh.
- So can I stay with you?

00:11:12.463 --> 00:11:15.965
But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.680
Ah, look who's back.

00:11:21.847 --> 00:11:24.265
Why do you have bags?
Rach, why does she have bags?

00:11:24.725 --> 00:11:26.351
I'm staying with you guys.

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:28.645
- What?
- We're gonna be roomies!

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:29.854
Come on.

00:11:39.281 --> 00:11:40.865
- You slept out here?
- Yeah.

00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:45.412
Amy kept kicking me in her sleep,
yelling, "Myron, get off!"

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.125
But, uh, we're getting rid of her, right?
Please tell me we're getting rid of her?

00:11:50.292 --> 00:11:52.585
- Joey, I can't do that.
- Oh, come on.

00:11:52.753 --> 00:11:55.547
Last night I was finishing off a pizza,
and she said:

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:58.091
"A moment on the lips,
forever on the hips."

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:02.470
I don't need that kind of talk
in my house!

00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:04.639
Joey, look, I know that she's difficult...

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:07.434
...but I think it's really good
that she's here.

00:12:08.728 --> 00:12:11.938
Because we'll appreciate it
more when she's gone?

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:17.610
No, it's just... Look, when I first moved
to this city, I was a lot like her.

00:12:17.778 --> 00:12:22.240
I was spoiled, self-centered.
And you guys really took care of me.

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:24.367
Yeah. Monica made us.

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:27.829
Well, whatever. I really appreciate it...

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:31.082
...because I don't think I would be
the person that I am today...

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.084
...if it wasn't for you guys.

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:35.837
So I want to help Amy
the way you guys helped me.

00:12:36.005 --> 00:12:39.299
And I know it's gonna take patience,
but that's okay.

00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:42.969
- Good morning.
- Yeah.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.306
Amy, that's what I
was supposed to wear today.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.141
That's why I hung it on the door.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:50.435
Oh, sweetie, you can't pull this off.

00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:58.735
Amy, you know what? I was thinking that
maybe now would be a good time...

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:02.697
...for us to sit down and, you know,
talk about your future.

00:13:02.865 --> 00:13:05.742
Oh, I can't, honey. I'm gonna go
get my eyebrows shaped.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.368
I am not happy.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:12.749
Uh... Sure you want to eat that?

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:17.754
I'm curvy and I like it!

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:23.510
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:13:23.677 --> 00:13:26.346
I just had the worst anniversary ever.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.681
I doubt that.
Tell her about us last year.

00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:34.187
Oh, well, I bought Chandler a $500 watch,
and he wrote me a rap song.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.900
- Seriously?
- Word.

00:13:41.278 --> 00:13:42.487
Well, mine was worse than that.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.864
- Well, what happened?
- We were at the game...

00:13:45.032 --> 00:13:47.784
...and this guy proposed to his girlfriend
on the big screen thing.

00:13:47.952 --> 00:13:50.662
- Oh, that is so tacky.
- Well, that's what I said.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.500
But it turns out Mike was planning to
propose to me that same way last night.

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.710
Oh, my God. Mike was gonna propose?

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.046
- Phoebe, that's huge.
- Do you want to marry him?

00:14:00.214 --> 00:14:02.298
Yeah, I really do. Yes.

00:14:02.466 --> 00:14:04.884
But after I dumped on the way
he was gonna propose...

00:14:05.052 --> 00:14:06.886
...I don't think he's ever gonna ask again.

00:14:07.054 --> 00:14:09.556
I mean, I said no in Barbados,
and now this?

00:14:09.723 --> 00:14:12.559
She's right. If I were a guy and...

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:20.441
Did I just say, "If I were a guy"?

00:14:21.193 --> 00:14:22.986
Maybe you don't need him
to propose to you.

00:14:23.153 --> 00:14:24.571
Maybe you could propose to him.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:28.491
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
Isn't that a little desperate?

00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:30.869
I proposed to Chandler.

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:36.583
All right, moving on.

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:39.294
I don't think it was desperate.
I think it was amazing.

00:14:39.461 --> 00:14:40.503
Thank you.

00:14:40.671 --> 00:14:44.799
- Well, do you think I should propose?
- I think it could be kind of great.

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:49.220
Absolutely. You'll love the feeling.
There's nothing like it.

00:14:51.724 --> 00:14:54.309
Okay. Okay. So how should I do it?

00:14:54.518 --> 00:14:56.769
How about at a game on the big screen?

00:14:56.937 --> 00:15:00.481
Huh! How about at a Foot Locker?

00:15:01.525 --> 00:15:05.653
What? What, he obviously thinks
that's a nice way to be proposed to.

00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:09.407
- Plus, he'd never suspect it.
- Yeah, that does make sense.

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:13.244
- Okay, now, would you two like that?
- Sounds good to me.

00:15:13.412 --> 00:15:15.622
But what would a guy think?

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:20.668
- Uh, Nana's on the phone.
- Wow.

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:24.505
That's interesting,
since she died seven years ago.

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:26.758
She did?

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:29.135
Who got her condo in Boca?

00:15:30.304 --> 00:15:31.763
Hello?

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:34.682
It's our nanny.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:36.267
Hi.

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:41.147
Oh, God, I hope you feel better.
Okay. Bye.

00:15:41.315 --> 00:15:43.066
That's Molly. She's sick.

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:46.361
- Can you watch Emma today?
- I can't. I have back-to-back classes.

00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:49.530
Did Molly say what she had?
Because my throat's been hurting.

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:51.532
Menstrual cramps.

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.828
I don't think that's what this is.

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:59.791
- Can any of you watch Emma?
- No, I'm sorry, sweetie.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.835
No, I've got work,
and then I'm proposing.

00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:05.546
Great. Shoot. What am I gonna do?

00:16:05.714 --> 00:16:07.590
Well, I could do it.

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:11.219
- Well, actually...
- Can I talk to you for a second?

00:16:11.387 --> 00:16:12.553
Yeah.

00:16:12.721 --> 00:16:15.807
Um, I do not want her
babysitting our child.

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:19.560
- Why not?
- For one thing, she keeps calling her Ella.

00:16:19.770 --> 00:16:23.064
- Ella's a nice name.
- Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.

00:16:23.273 --> 00:16:25.358
- What, the next one?
- Okay.

00:16:26.902 --> 00:16:29.320
I don't want her watching our baby.

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:32.699
Ross, I am trying to help her
become a better person.

00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:34.784
This is a huge breakthrough for her.

00:16:34.952 --> 00:16:39.205
She just offered to do something
for another human being.

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:41.958
- You know, I don't know.
- Ross, I'm telling you...

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:45.962
...she's giving up getting her eyebrows
shaped to do this, all right?

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:49.841
Do you understand how important
that is in our world?

00:16:50.384 --> 00:16:56.180
Uh, listen, I couldn't help but overhear,
because I was trying to.

00:16:57.766 --> 00:17:00.685
Listen, let me do this.
I really want to help you guys out.

00:17:00.853 --> 00:17:04.063
And plus, Rachel's been
so wonderful to me.

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.318
- Absolutely.
- Oh, great!

00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:11.738
So how much does it pay?

00:17:18.078 --> 00:17:20.329
Hey, Joe. How's the second draft
of the letter coming?

00:17:20.497 --> 00:17:23.833
Great. I'm finished. In fact,
I just dropped it off at the agency.

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.920
- You dropped it off?
- Yeah.

00:17:28.088 --> 00:17:30.089
Can we read it?
Can you print out another copy?

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.050
No can do, amigo.

00:17:33.761 --> 00:17:37.513
No, I didn't use the computer.
It felt more personal to handwrite it.

00:17:38.348 --> 00:17:40.433
- You handwrote it?
- Yeah, and don't worry.

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:43.102
I didn't try to sound smart at all.

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:45.521
See you later.

00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:49.400
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
That letter is gonna go in our file.

00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:51.402
We're never gonna get a kid.

00:17:51.612 --> 00:17:53.780
We're gonna be
one of those old couples...

00:17:53.947 --> 00:17:57.283
...that collects orchids
or has a lot of birds.

00:17:57.534 --> 00:17:59.202
It's okay. It's okay. You know what?

00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:02.789
I will just call the agency
and tell them to throw out the letter.

00:18:02.956 --> 00:18:04.499
Okay, good.

00:18:05.292 --> 00:18:06.834
Hello, this is Chandler Bing.

00:18:07.002 --> 00:18:11.297
Someone just dropped off a handwritten
recommendation letter and...

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:15.343
Uh-huh.

00:18:16.553 --> 00:18:17.595
Okay.

00:18:18.847 --> 00:18:21.516
Thank you. Goodbye.

00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:23.559
We're screwed, aren't we?

00:18:23.727 --> 00:18:26.437
You know what? Just tell me
on the way to the bird store.

00:18:28.107 --> 00:18:29.440
- They loved it.
- What?

00:18:29.608 --> 00:18:33.694
They thought it was very smart of us to have
a child write the recommendation letter.

00:18:34.905 --> 00:18:36.823
They thought Joey was a child?

00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:40.034
She guessed 8, 9,
based on his drawings.

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:45.706
- Hi.
- What'd you guys do today?

00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:51.003
Ella wanted to go out, so we went
shopping and got some sushi.

00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:54.590
- That sounds like fun.
- Yeah, not really.

00:18:54.758 --> 00:18:56.300
Babies are dull.

00:18:58.011 --> 00:19:01.931
- Hey. Hi, how's my girl?
- I'm fine.

00:19:02.891 --> 00:19:06.602
And I got you a present
for letting me stay with you.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.856
- Ready?
- Yeah.

00:19:10.566 --> 00:19:12.024
Ta-da!

00:19:13.861 --> 00:19:15.820
You pierced her ears?

00:19:16.029 --> 00:19:18.865
Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?

00:19:24.288 --> 00:19:26.789
You pierced her ears?

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:29.375
How could you do this
without telling me?

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:33.254
If I had told you, then it wouldn't
have been a surprise, now would it?

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.173
I think she looks cute.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.134
But I am wrong.

00:19:38.969 --> 00:19:43.347
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.

00:19:43.724 --> 00:19:46.100
Why, did something happen
to his falafel cart?

00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:49.187
- Hey, guys.
- Ross!

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:53.274
Hi, Emma.
Oh. Why is she wearing her hat so low?

00:19:53.483 --> 00:19:56.402
- She can barely see.
- I don't really want her to see.

00:19:58.322 --> 00:19:59.363
Why not?

00:19:59.531 --> 00:20:02.200
Because there are so many
terrible sights in this world.

00:20:02.367 --> 00:20:05.745
Like war. Or that thing
in Joey's refrigerator. Remember?

00:20:05.913 --> 00:20:08.998
It was in a milk carton,
but it looked like meat?

00:20:09.708 --> 00:20:11.792
Come here. Come here.

00:20:12.002 --> 00:20:15.338
There she is. Hi.

00:20:16.798 --> 00:20:20.051
- What?
- Nothing.

00:20:21.094 --> 00:20:22.803
Hi.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:25.890
What...?

00:20:37.027 --> 00:20:40.905
- Please tell me those are clip-ons!
- Oh, they're real.

00:20:41.448 --> 00:20:43.616
Did she do this to her?

00:20:43.784 --> 00:20:46.244
I told you we shouldn't have
left Emma with her!

00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:48.371
I know. And you were right, Ross.

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.166
Okay? You are so irresponsible!
I am never letting you babysit again!

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:54.293
You know what?
This kid needs me, okay?

00:20:54.461 --> 00:20:58.339
- She needs to have a cool, fun aunt.
- I'm a cool, fun aunt.

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:00.299
Okay.

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:06.264
Hey! Monica can be cool and fun
at organized indoor projects.

00:21:07.683 --> 00:21:11.602
All I wanted to do was help you try
to figure out what to do with your life.

00:21:11.812 --> 00:21:13.062
This is how you repay me?

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:16.983
I don't need you to help me. I already
know what I'm gonna do with my life.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:20.653
- Oh, yeah? Since when?
- Since today.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:26.033
I am going to be a baby stylist.

00:21:27.119 --> 00:21:30.371
- What?
- That's not a thing!

00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:32.999
Well, it should be.

00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:35.960
I'm gonna help babies learn
how to accessorize...

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:39.505
...what colors to wear,
what clothes are slimming.

00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:43.843
- Babies don't care if they're slim!
- Enter Amy.

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:48.139
- Amy, I... I just... I just wanna...
- What? What are you gonna do?

00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:52.768
No more falafel for you!

00:22:04.948 --> 00:22:07.366
- Great game, huh?
- Uh-huh.

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:13.998
- Why do you keep looking at the screen?
- I'm not. I'm praying.

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.375
Please let the Knicks win.

00:22:16.543 --> 00:22:18.711
Thank you, Thor.

00:22:19.796 --> 00:22:22.423
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

00:22:22.591 --> 00:22:24.759
- Well, I think you should wait.
- Why?

00:22:25.969 --> 00:22:30.389
Well, if you don't hold it in,
you don't get all the nutrients.

00:22:31.016 --> 00:22:34.727
Please turn your attention
to the big screen on the scoreboard.

00:22:35.437 --> 00:22:38.939
Someone has a special question to ask.

00:22:41.443 --> 00:22:44.320
Mike Hannigan, will you marry me?

00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:49.575
Get a load of this.
She's proposing to him!

00:22:49.743 --> 00:22:53.371
Guess we know who wears the pants
in that family.

00:22:53.538 --> 00:22:56.165
Well, that's not very enlightened.

00:22:57.584 --> 00:22:59.960
Hey! Hey!

00:23:00.253 --> 00:23:03.339
Boo us? Boo you!

00:23:09.262 --> 00:23:13.099
Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani.

00:23:13.266 --> 00:23:15.184
Oh, hi.

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:19.355
Well, I'm glad you liked my letter.

00:23:20.774 --> 00:23:24.402
No, my mommy and daddy
aren't home right now.

00:23:25.695 --> 00:23:27.947
Okay, bye-bye.

00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:32.910
She was nice.

00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:36.497
Joey, get Amy's bags.
She is moving out.

00:23:36.665 --> 00:23:37.998
Woo-hoo!

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:42.795
- You're kicking me out?
- You put holes in my baby's ears.

00:23:43.004 --> 00:23:45.172
At least now people
will know she's a girl!

00:23:47.676 --> 00:23:50.302
I can't believe I ever
even tried to help you.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.055
- You are so beyond help!
- You know what?

00:23:53.265 --> 00:23:56.225
Ever since I got here,
you have been nothing but negative.

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:58.060
- Excuse me?
- You didn't want me...

00:23:58.228 --> 00:24:00.604
...to marry the old guy
with the great apartment.

00:24:00.772 --> 00:24:05.568
Then I tried to help your daughter
de-emphasize her flaws...

00:24:05.735 --> 00:24:07.820
...and suddenly I'm the bad guy?

00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:11.907
- Joey, where are those bags?
- She has a lot of crap!

00:24:12.659 --> 00:24:15.995
You know? When I moved in here,
I thought, "This will be so great.

00:24:16.163 --> 00:24:19.248
Just us sisters back together again
like when we were kids."

00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:22.418
Except without that stupid Jill. Oh.

00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:24.879
Who has gotten fat, by the way.

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:28.090
Seriously?

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:30.843
Mom said she gained, like, 15 pounds.

00:24:31.052 --> 00:24:33.846
- Hips or thighs?
- Ass and face.

00:24:35.265 --> 00:24:38.058
Oh, my God!
I thought she was on Atkins.

00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:40.227
She was. Carbs found her.

00:24:44.649 --> 00:24:47.276
See? This is what I wanted.

00:24:47.444 --> 00:24:51.030
Two sisters talking about real stuff.

00:24:53.617 --> 00:24:55.618
Oh, I can give you that.

00:24:56.161 --> 00:24:58.162
- You can?
- Yeah.

00:24:58.371 --> 00:25:01.248
I kept trying to make you
a better person, but you're...

00:25:01.416 --> 00:25:04.752
You're already a pretty perfect version
of what you are.

00:25:05.795 --> 00:25:07.755
Thank you.

00:25:07.923 --> 00:25:10.591
You gotta admit, Emma does look cute.

00:25:12.219 --> 00:25:15.721
- Did you just say, "Emma"?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Ella.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:25.147
That woman didn't know what
she was talking about, Mike.

00:25:25.315 --> 00:25:27.650
Obviously, you have balls.

00:25:28.902 --> 00:25:31.862
- Please, let's just forget the whole thing.
- I would love it.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:33.948
- Consider it forgotten.
- Thank you.

00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:36.450
But just so you know...

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:42.248
However and whenever you decide
to propose, I promise I'll say yes.

00:25:42.707 --> 00:25:44.917
Whether, you know,
it's at a basketball game...

00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:47.002
...or in skywriting...

00:25:47.170 --> 00:25:49.880
...or, you know, like some lame
guy in a cheesy movie...

00:25:50.048 --> 00:25:52.091
...who hides it in the cake.

00:25:57.597 --> 00:26:00.307
It's in the cake, isn't it?

00:26:01.393 --> 00:26:04.895
Where else would lame
Mr. No-Balls hide it?

00:26:05.063 --> 00:26:07.898
What's the matter with me?
Why do I keep ruining this?

00:26:08.066 --> 00:26:10.484
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No, it's my fault.

00:26:10.694 --> 00:26:13.195
I keep trying to propose
in these stupid ways...

00:26:13.363 --> 00:26:17.575
...and I just wanna tell you I love you,
and I wanna spend my life with you...

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:25.207
- I'm gonna do this now.
- Oh, my God.

00:26:28.753 --> 00:26:30.838
- Phoebe, I...
- Wait. Oh, wait.

00:26:35.343 --> 00:26:37.052
Oh, no.

00:26:42.142 --> 00:26:43.225
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

00:26:43.393 --> 00:26:44.810
Okay.

00:26:47.397 --> 00:26:50.107
Phoebe, I love you.

00:26:51.693 --> 00:26:55.154
There's no one else in the world I would
ask to marry me three times.

00:26:57.657 --> 00:27:00.075
But I want to take care of you...

00:27:00.243 --> 00:27:01.660
...have babies with you...

00:27:03.121 --> 00:27:05.247
...and grow old with you.

00:27:07.334 --> 00:27:10.377
Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

00:27:11.421 --> 00:27:13.172
Yes.

00:27:19.679 --> 00:27:22.181
- I love you.
- I love you more.

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:23.557
Not possible.

00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:35.569
She's gonna be Mrs. No-Balls!

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:44.703
So how's the, uh, baby-styling
business going?

00:27:44.871 --> 00:27:46.997
Not that great.

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:51.043
It's almost as if people don't want
to hear that their babies are ugly.

00:27:52.504 --> 00:27:54.713
That's shocking.

00:27:55.799 --> 00:27:58.759
There's Ross. Hey, Ross.

00:28:00.303 --> 00:28:02.805
Hello, Ross?

00:28:04.516 --> 00:28:06.100
He's rude.
