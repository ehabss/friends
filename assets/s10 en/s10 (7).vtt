WEBVTT

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:06.088
Hey, you guys.

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:07.673
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.968
- Figuring out our wedding plans.
- We were doing the same thing.

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:12.636
Yeah.

00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:17.307
It's really crazy.
The hall, the dress, the food.

00:00:17.475 --> 00:00:20.894
- I had no idea how expensive this stuff was.
- Yeah, it is really pricey.

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:24.606
- I freaked when I heard the numbers.
- So, what did you two do about it?

00:00:24.774 --> 00:00:27.693
It was simple. I came up with
some cost-cutting solutions...

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.863
...wrote out a list
and Monica told me to go to hell.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:33.657
There's no way around it.

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:36.577
Just accept that this is
gonna cost a lot of money.

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:40.205
I heard that weddings are, like,
a $40 billion-a-year industry.

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.375
Yeah. And I'm responsible
for just, like, half of that.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:48.422
But really, it does seem like this money
could be put to better use.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.673
Are you serious?

00:00:49.841 --> 00:00:53.177
Yeah. Now, how would you feel if we gave
all the wedding money to charity...

00:00:53.344 --> 00:00:55.721
...and we just got married at City Hall?

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:59.183
I think it would make me
wanna marry you even more.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.229
Well, I gotta say, you guys,
that's an incredible gesture.

00:01:04.397 --> 00:01:06.398
Maybe you do that
next time you get married.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.613
No, no, no. The next time's
gonna be Hawaii at sunset.

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.740
But maybe the time after that.

00:01:55.824 --> 00:01:57.157
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:58.408
What's going on?

00:01:58.576 --> 00:02:02.204
Our adoption social worker is coming by,
so we're cleaning the apartment.

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.081
"We"?

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:08.669
You know you don't want me to help.
You can't have it both ways.

00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:12.923
Hey, is this the person who decides
whether or not you get a baby?

00:02:13.091 --> 00:02:16.468
- Kind of. She's coming to see where we live.
- And it has to go perfectly.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:21.014
If she doesn't like us, she can keep
us off every adoption list in the state.

00:02:21.182 --> 00:02:24.393
Hey, maybe I should stop by.
She could be a soap-opera fan.

00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:28.021
It's very impressive when
the little people know a celebrity.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:30.357
"Little people"?

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:32.317
"Celebrity."

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.487
So I think I'm just about done here.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:40.367
Unless you have any bad stuff hidden
somewhere, like porn or cigarettes?

00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:42.244
What?

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:46.123
- No.
- Chandler.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:52.546
I don't, and I'm offended
by the insinuation.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:55.340
So there's not a magazine
under the couch...

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:58.510
...or a pack of cigarettes
taped to the back of the toilet tank...

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:01.221
...or a filthy video in the VCR?

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:04.099
I'll admit to the cigarettes
and the magazine.

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:05.851
But that tape is not mine.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.105
- It isn't mine.
- I guess we'll never know whose it is.

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:19.198
- May I help you?
- Yes.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:22.618
We're here to make a rather
sizable donation to the children.

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:25.412
Well, any contribution,
large or small, is appreciated.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.707
Well, I think you're gonna appreciate
the crap out of this one.

00:03:28.875 --> 00:03:32.336
- Well, this is very generous.
- And we don't want any recognition.

00:03:32.503 --> 00:03:34.171
This is completely anonymous.

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.924
Completely anonymous.
From two kind strangers.

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:40.135
Mr. X and Phoebe Buffay.

00:03:41.262 --> 00:03:43.180
We can put your names
in our newsletter.

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:46.266
- Not necessary.
- Buffay is spelled B-U-F-F-A-Y.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:51.521
And X is spelled, uh, "Mike Hannigan."

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.359
All right, well, on behalf of the children,
thank you both very much.

00:03:55.526 --> 00:03:59.863
- Sure. I'm glad we did this. It feels so good.
- It does. It feels really good.

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:02.616
Oh, look.
And we get these free T-shirts.

00:04:02.784 --> 00:04:06.036
Actually, that's the shirt
I wore to the gym.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:07.996
It's moist.

00:04:11.167 --> 00:04:13.835
- Emma will be up in a minute.
- Oh, good.

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:18.423
Oh, hey, Ross, listen. I heard about
you and Charlie. I'm really sorry.

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:22.803
Aw, that's okay. I'm sure there are tons of
other beautiful paleontologists out there.

00:04:22.971 --> 00:04:25.764
- Absolutely.
- There was one. She's it.

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:29.142
All the rest look like
they should live under a bridge.

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.272
So, uh, what are you gonna do today?

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.899
Well, I was thinking of taking Emma
to the playground.

00:04:36.234 --> 00:04:38.610
Oh, my God. What?

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:44.783
Like I said, I was thinking of taking
Emma to the Museum of Knives and Fire.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.041
Okay, look, Ross. I do not want
Emma going to the playground.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.462
Because?

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.383
All right, if you must know,
I had a traumatic...

00:05:01.551 --> 00:05:05.178
...swing incident when I was little.

00:05:06.055 --> 00:05:08.015
- Seriously?
- Yes. I was 4 years old.

00:05:08.182 --> 00:05:10.017
And I was on the swing...

00:05:10.184 --> 00:05:14.021
...and then all of a sudden my hair
got tangled in the chain.

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:20.777
And to get me out, my mom had
to cut a big chunk of my hair.

00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:24.114
And it was uneven for weeks.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.498
And you made it through that?

00:05:34.834 --> 00:05:38.003
I wonder who's gonna play you
in the movie.

00:05:39.297 --> 00:05:43.175
Okay, fine, you can make fun of me.
I do not want Emma going there.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.969
And I was thinking Claire Danes.

00:05:46.971 --> 00:05:49.431
Look, I'm sorry to hear
about your tragedy.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.393
Okay? But the swings are perfectly safe.
And besides, Emma loves them.

00:05:53.561 --> 00:05:58.565
- You should come, and you'll see.
- Those things go, like, 40 miles an hour.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:01.068
And there's that moment
when you're at the top...

00:06:01.235 --> 00:06:05.072
...when you just don't know
if you're gonna return back to Earth.

00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:09.618
Space is filled with orbiting children.

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.790
Look, please, just come on.

00:06:14.957 --> 00:06:18.627
When you see the look on Emma's face,
I swear, you won't regret it.

00:06:21.297 --> 00:06:22.756
- All right.
- Good.

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:24.383
You don't wanna be a mothers...

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:27.761
...who pass on their irrational fears
to their children, do you?

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.388
"Irrational," huh?

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:33.308
I'll remember that next time you freak
out about a spider in your apartment.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:34.559
Oh, yeah, that's the same.

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:37.771
I'm sure there are 30 different species
of poisonous swings.

00:06:42.026 --> 00:06:44.152
Oh, my God. The adoption lady is early.

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.071
Okay. Okay. Here we go.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.656
- Okay.
- Here we go.

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:49.074
Stand up straight.

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.076
Big smile.

00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:56.498
Hello. Is this the Creepy residence?

00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:00.085
We're waiting for the adoption lady.
But, hey, I'm glad you're here.

00:07:00.253 --> 00:07:02.796
I was cleaning this morning
and I found this.

00:07:02.964 --> 00:07:06.007
I don't know if you wanna use it, but...

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:09.261
Oh, this is so sweet of you.

00:07:09.429 --> 00:07:13.223
Oh, but I won't be needing a veil.
I actually won't be wearing a dress at all.

00:07:13.391 --> 00:07:16.351
I told you, I am not coming
to a naked wedding.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:18.812
No, no, no.
We're not having a big reception.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.856
We took the wedding money
we were gonna spend...

00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:22.899
...and donated it to a children's charity.

00:07:23.067 --> 00:07:24.693
That's crazy!

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:30.991
I'm sorry. I can't imagine giving up
my one wedding day like that.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:34.494
Yeah, well, we're different.
I don't care about having a huge party.

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:36.955
This is really nice for you, but...

00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:40.709
Oh, please. I put this on
and, ugh, I just look like...

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.752
Well, radiant.

00:07:45.089 --> 00:07:49.009
All right, but who cares? You know,
I don't need a pretty veil and a fancy dress.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.178
That's right.
You're making a commitment.

00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:54.848
And, you know, that's the same
whether you do it at the Plaza or...

00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.933
- Where you gonna do it?
- City Hall.

00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:58.602
Oh!

00:07:58.811 --> 00:08:01.730
Oh, that sounds nice.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:06.151
I was just there for jury duty.
They've really spruced that place up.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.947
Okay. No, it's okay. It's okay. It's okay.
I've made my decision.

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.867
What I really want
is a great big wedding.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.952
Yay!

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:20.665
- But you gave all the money to charity.
- Well, I'll just ask for it back.

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:24.294
- I don't think you can do that.
- Why not?

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:28.757
This is her wedding day. That's way
more important than some stupid kids.

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:33.428
That's sweet, honey,
but save something for the adoption lady.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:42.854
- All right, okay. Be careful.
- Okay.

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:46.399
Careful. Watch her hair. Watch her hair!

00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:50.237
- Rach, she's got, like, three hairs.
- I know. I know.

00:08:50.404 --> 00:08:55.617
But they're just so beautiful.
Oh, my God, I just pulled one out.

00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:59.329
I promise you she's safe, okay?
Watch how much she loves this.

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:03.166
- Okay. Okay.
- Are you ready, sweetie? Here we go.

00:09:04.168 --> 00:09:09.005
Okay, careful. Okay. Oh.

00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:13.343
She's smiling.

00:09:13.511 --> 00:09:15.929
Look at that, she does like it.

00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:19.516
- See, I told you.
- Oh. Ah!

00:09:22.937 --> 00:09:26.731
Oh, my God. Look at her,
she's a little daredevil.

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.985
- Oh, God. Let me push. Can I push?
- Oh, absolutely.

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:34.823
Okay. Oh, God. Okay, get the camera.
It's in the diaper bag.

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:36.408
Okay.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:41.788
See? Scared of the swings.
I bet you feel pretty silly. Aah!

00:09:45.793 --> 00:09:47.836
We're seriously asking
for the money back?

00:09:48.004 --> 00:09:49.546
It's for our wedding day.

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:53.883
All right, now, is this guy gay or straight?
Because one of us has to start flirting.

00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:57.387
Wow. You here to make another
donation the same day?

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.639
I don't think that's ever happened before.

00:09:59.849 --> 00:10:01.516
Gay. Go.

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.314
Oh, my God, I love your shirt.

00:10:08.816 --> 00:10:13.361
The donation we made earlier?
Um, well, we want it back.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:15.697
Excuse me?

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:19.367
See, okay, that money was for
a big wedding we thought we didn't want.

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:21.369
But it turns out we do.

00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:24.623
So you're asking us to refund
your donation to the children?

00:10:25.082 --> 00:10:26.541
Yeah.

00:10:27.835 --> 00:10:30.170
This feels really good.

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:37.344
Yeah, I'm sorry. I am. But this wedding's
just really important to me.

00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:41.181
Hey, it's none of my business.
Besides, this is probably a good thing.

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:45.977
We've really been spoiling the children,
what with all the food and warm clothing.

00:10:46.604 --> 00:10:49.689
That's not fair.
A person's wedding is important.

00:10:49.857 --> 00:10:51.483
And especially to me.

00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:55.445
Okay, I didn't have a graduation party.
And I didn't go to prom.

00:10:55.613 --> 00:10:59.366
And I spent my sweet 16
being chased around a tire yard...

00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:03.203
...by an escaped mental patient who,
in his own words, wanted to:

00:11:03.371 --> 00:11:05.038
"Kill me, or whatever."

00:11:06.624 --> 00:11:09.584
So I deserve a real celebration.

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:14.130
And I'm not gonna let some sweaty
little man make me feel badly about it.

00:11:18.594 --> 00:11:21.262
She could've been talking about
either one of us.

00:11:27.436 --> 00:11:30.397
Hi, I'm Laura.
I'm here for your adoption interview.

00:11:30.564 --> 00:11:33.191
Hi, I'm Monica. And this is Chandler.

00:11:33.359 --> 00:11:35.568
- Hi. Thank you.
- Please come in.

00:11:35.736 --> 00:11:38.780
- Would you like something to drink?
- Water would be fine.

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:41.116
We're so glad that you're here.

00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:43.910
We're really excited about
getting this process started.

00:11:44.078 --> 00:11:47.080
Because we love kids.
Love them to death.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:50.667
Well, not actually to death.
That's just a figure of speech.

00:11:50.835 --> 00:11:53.044
We love kids the appropriate amount...

00:11:54.714 --> 00:11:57.006
...as allowed by law.

00:11:58.884 --> 00:12:01.136
- Your place is just lovely.
- Thank you.

00:12:01.303 --> 00:12:05.306
Yes, this building does have
a wholesome, family feel to it.

00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:07.767
I feel like I've been here before.

00:12:07.935 --> 00:12:09.936
Are any other couples
in the building adopting?

00:12:10.104 --> 00:12:11.938
Is that that couple on the first floor?

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:14.482
Because we should get a baby
before them.

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:16.526
That guy tried to sell me drugs.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:21.614
But other than that,
wholesome, wholesome building.

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:23.867
Oh.

00:12:24.034 --> 00:12:27.537
- What?
- I just realized why I remember this place.

00:12:27.705 --> 00:12:29.873
- Really? What is it?
- Oh, it's nothing.

00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.335
I went on a date with a guy who lived
in this building. It didn't end very well.

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:37.464
That wouldn't, by any chance,
be Joey Tribbiani?

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:40.592
- Yes!
- Of course it was.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:45.764
We had a great night. In the morning,
he promised he'd call and he didn't.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:47.432
Rat bastard!

00:12:49.477 --> 00:12:52.103
- So you're not friends with him?
- Oh, God, no.

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:54.439
- No, no, no.
- No. Nope.

00:12:54.607 --> 00:12:58.526
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no. No.

00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:00.236
No.

00:13:01.947 --> 00:13:04.324
Well, I'm sorry I brought it up.

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:07.035
So are either one of you planning
on staying at home?

00:13:08.412 --> 00:13:12.624
Hello? Anybody in there order a celebrity?

00:13:12.875 --> 00:13:14.751
Ow!

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:17.253
What was that?

00:13:17.421 --> 00:13:21.049
That's just some crazy guy
who roams the halls here.

00:13:21.217 --> 00:13:23.092
He's great with kids, though.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:34.354
- Ross. Oh, my God, are you okay?
- Son of a bitch!

00:13:38.275 --> 00:13:40.944
Oh, relax. I didn't say the F-word.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.032
Ross, see, I told you!
Those swings are evil!

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.283
All right. That is it.

00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:51.120
That's the last time Emma is getting on
one of those things for her entire life.

00:13:51.288 --> 00:13:54.874
No, no, no. Okay, it wasn't
the swing's fault. It was my fault.

00:13:55.042 --> 00:13:58.086
And kind of that kid's fault.

00:13:58.295 --> 00:14:01.256
Who is still laughing. Nice.

00:14:01.465 --> 00:14:05.009
Come on. Can we just get out of here
before somebody else gets hurt?

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:08.429
No. Okay, okay. Wait. I have an idea.
I want you to get on the swing...

00:14:08.597 --> 00:14:11.975
...and you'll see that there's
nothing to be afraid of.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.188
I know what this is all about.

00:14:17.648 --> 00:14:20.358
You've always been jealous of my hair.

00:14:21.485 --> 00:14:25.572
I just think you're an adult, okay?
And you should get over your silly fears.

00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:27.907
- All right, fine. I'll do it.
- Good.

00:14:28.075 --> 00:14:31.119
- If you hold a spider.
- Where? Where?

00:14:31.787 --> 00:14:34.247
If you hold a spider.

00:14:34.456 --> 00:14:36.124
I know.

00:14:43.924 --> 00:14:45.800
Guys, is everything okay?
It's me, Joey.

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.471
Adoption!

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:53.516
What's going on?

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.269
Oh, it's just like I said, that crazy...

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:59.147
...Bert, roaming the halls.

00:15:00.524 --> 00:15:03.192
- Guys?
- Keep on roaming, Bert!

00:15:03.485 --> 00:15:06.321
We don't want any crazy today!

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:10.783
- What's going on?
- We'll talk later, Bert. Everything's fine!

00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:14.078
Everything doesn't sound fine.

00:15:14.288 --> 00:15:16.581
Is he all right out there by himself?

00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:20.001
Oh, yeah. He has a caretaker.
His older brother...

00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:21.336
...Ernie.

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:27.550
- Bert and Ernie?
- You can't make this stuff up.

00:15:29.762 --> 00:15:32.847
You never told me about that guy
and your sweet 16.

00:15:33.015 --> 00:15:35.558
- I'm sorry about that.
- Oh, it ended okay.

00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:37.977
One of my friends shot him.

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:43.232
Well, at least you'll get a proper wedding.
You really deserve that.

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:47.236
Yeah, I really do.
You know, I had nothing growing up.

00:15:49.573 --> 00:15:52.241
Just like the kids I took the money from.

00:15:52.409 --> 00:15:57.205
No. No, no. I see where this is going.
Don't make me go back there.

00:15:58.248 --> 00:16:02.335
Look, I can't have a wedding
with this money now. It's tainted.

00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.963
Fine, we'll give the money back.

00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.590
If that guy at the charity
gives us a hard time...

00:16:07.758 --> 00:16:11.052
...my friend hasn't shot anyone
in a really long time.

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.349
I must say this seems like a lovely
environment to raise a child in.

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:19.352
You are welcome to look
under any of the furniture...

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.147
...because, believe me, you won't find
any porn or cigarettes under there.

00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:28.695
Before we look around, let me make sure
I have everything I need up to here.

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:37.036
Why don't I show you the baby's room.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.960
- What are you doing?
- You wouldn't let me in.

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:46.379
- I thought you were in trouble.
- Well, we're not.

00:16:46.547 --> 00:16:48.881
But you called me "Bert."

00:16:49.383 --> 00:16:51.551
That's our code word for danger.

00:16:52.636 --> 00:16:55.972
- We don't have a code word.
- We don't?

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:58.349
We really should.

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:02.603
From now on, "Bert"
will be our code word for danger.

00:17:02.771 --> 00:17:05.398
So that was the baby's room.

00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:11.487
- Uh, what room should we see next?
- Any room that isn't behind this couch.

00:17:13.365 --> 00:17:17.035
Some people don't get him,
but I think he's really funny.

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:26.836
I did not care for that.

00:17:27.629 --> 00:17:28.921
You have to get out of here.

00:17:29.089 --> 00:17:31.716
You slept with our social worker
and never called her back.

00:17:31.884 --> 00:17:33.968
She is still pissed, so she can't see you.

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:35.970
Okay, okay.

00:17:38.891 --> 00:17:41.684
- What?
- I forgot my bat.

00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:46.397
Oh, my God.

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:50.735
And for the last time,
we do not want to be friends with you!

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.573
And we don't wanna buy your bat!

00:17:57.284 --> 00:17:59.077
What are you doing here?

00:17:59.286 --> 00:18:01.954
Bert. Bert. Bert. Bert.

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:09.128
- Are you friends with him?
- I can explain.

00:18:09.838 --> 00:18:11.422
Joey?

00:18:12.174 --> 00:18:14.092
All right. Okay. Uh...

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.137
Wow. Yeah...

00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:21.182
You have got some nerve
coming back here.

00:18:23.018 --> 00:18:25.728
- I can't believe you never called me.
- Excuse me?

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:29.982
You probably don't even remember
my name. It's Joey, by the way.

00:18:30.150 --> 00:18:34.529
And don't bother telling me yours,
because I totally remember it, lady.

00:18:37.074 --> 00:18:39.158
I waited weeks for you to call me.

00:18:39.326 --> 00:18:41.410
I gave you my number.
You never called me.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.746
Don't try to turn this around on me.

00:18:43.914 --> 00:18:47.917
I am not some kind of social work...

00:18:48.085 --> 00:18:49.627
...that you can just...

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:51.254
...do.

00:18:54.299 --> 00:18:58.678
- I'm pretty sure I gave you my number.
- Really? Think about it. Come on.

00:18:58.846 --> 00:19:02.348
You're a beautiful woman. Smart, funny.

00:19:02.516 --> 00:19:05.434
We had a really good time. Huh?

00:19:06.353 --> 00:19:09.063
If I had your number,
why wouldn't I call you?

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:10.773
I don't know.

00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:15.194
Well, maybe I'm wrong. I'm sorry.

00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:20.241
Hey, too late for apologies. Okay?
You broke my heart.

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:23.619
You know how many women
I had to sleep with to get over you?

00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.125
- Joey, wait...
- No!

00:19:29.293 --> 00:19:32.253
I waited a long time!
I can't wait anymore.

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:38.676
I'm sorry that you had to see that.
I'm so embarrassed.

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:42.054
- Oh, that's really okay.
- Yeah. We totally understand.

00:19:42.222 --> 00:19:45.892
- Dating is hard.
- Boy, you people are nice.

00:19:47.644 --> 00:19:49.437
And I've got to say...

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:53.399
...I think you're going to make
excellent parents.

00:19:56.904 --> 00:19:58.821
Laura!

00:20:05.412 --> 00:20:07.205
We're back.

00:20:08.081 --> 00:20:10.249
Are you here to take more money?

00:20:10.417 --> 00:20:13.127
Because I think what you're
looking for is an ATM.

00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:16.005
No, no, we're here
to give the money back.

00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:20.051
Yeah. Because you know what?
It's all about the children.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:22.887
Although it's also about the wedding.

00:20:24.514 --> 00:20:26.974
Ugh. All right, here. No. Oh, God.

00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:30.978
If I haven't said so already,
sir, congratulations.

00:20:31.188 --> 00:20:33.231
Okay, look, enough, all right?

00:20:33.398 --> 00:20:35.358
I'm stepping in
and putting my foot down.

00:20:35.525 --> 00:20:38.986
As your future husband,
I'm gonna make this decision for us.

00:20:40.197 --> 00:20:42.657
What do you think we should do?

00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:46.661
- It's not your decision anymore.
- What?

00:20:46.828 --> 00:20:50.081
On behalf of the children of New York,
I reject your money.

00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:53.834
- But we're giving you this.
- And I'm giving it back to you.

00:20:54.002 --> 00:20:56.921
Come on. Consider it a contribution.

00:20:58.173 --> 00:21:00.716
Well, this is very generous.

00:21:00.884 --> 00:21:02.134
Please, take the check.

00:21:02.302 --> 00:21:05.596
Go have a great wedding
and a wonderful life together.

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:08.015
Sounds good to me. We can save up,
come back...

00:21:08.183 --> 00:21:10.726
- ...and make an even bigger donation.
- Absolutely.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:12.687
And when you do, ask for Brian.

00:21:12.854 --> 00:21:14.188
- Oh, is that you?
- No.

00:21:19.987 --> 00:21:21.320
Hello?

00:21:22.281 --> 00:21:24.073
Oh, hi.

00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:28.911
Oh, my God, really?
I can't wait to tell Chandler.

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:30.830
Okay. Goodbye.

00:21:31.290 --> 00:21:34.875
- Wrong number?
- That was Laura.

00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:38.296
She gave us a great report and
we're officially on the waiting list.

00:21:38.505 --> 00:21:40.923
- That's great.
- Now we just wait for a call...

00:21:41.091 --> 00:21:45.011
...and someone tells us
there's a baby waiting for us. Oh.

00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.316
Hello?

00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:00.651
Have you seen Joey's bat?

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.618
Okay. I got a spider.

00:22:09.786 --> 00:22:12.121
There were two, I picked the bigger one.

00:22:13.623 --> 00:22:16.042
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:21.630
This feels perfectly normal.

00:22:22.883 --> 00:22:25.259
Okay, get on the swing.

00:22:27.179 --> 00:22:28.721
Okay.

00:22:29.639 --> 00:22:39.065
Okay.

00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:43.027
Oh, okay.

00:22:44.446 --> 00:22:46.572
Wow. Whoa.

00:22:46.823 --> 00:22:49.492
- See?
- All right. I can do this.

00:22:49.659 --> 00:22:51.494
There you go. Good for you.

00:22:51.661 --> 00:22:54.121
You know what?
I'm getting used to this little guy.

00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:57.833
- I don't even feel him in here anymore.
- That's because he's on your neck.

00:22:59.878 --> 00:23:02.463
Whoa! Ross!
